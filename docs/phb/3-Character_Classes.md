Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

#### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

***Rage Damage.*** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike)—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

***Strength Advantage.*** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

***No Concentration or Spells.*** You can’t maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), and you can’t cast spells.

***Duration.*** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

* Make an attack roll against an enemy.
* Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
* Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the [Barbarian Features table](#BarbarianFeatures).

#### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The [Path of the Berserker](#PathoftheBerserker), [Path of the Wild Heart](#PathoftheWildHeart), [Path of the World Tree](#PathoftheWorldTree), and [Path of the Zealot](#PathoftheZealot) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

#### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at [level 1](#CoreBarbarianTraits).

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: [Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

#### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) rolls.

#### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

#### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage). If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

***Forceful Blow.*** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

***Hamstring Blow.*** The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

#### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), the DC resets to 10.

#### Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

***Staggering Blow.*** The target has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of your next turn.

***Sundering Blow.*** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition (not just the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Barbarian Subclasses

A Barbarian subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Path of the Berserker](#PathoftheBerserker), [Path of the Wild Heart](#PathoftheWildHeart), [Path of the World Tree](#PathoftheWorldTree), and [Path of the Zealot](#PathoftheZealot) subclasses.

#### Path of the Berserker

*Channel Rage into Violent Fury*

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

##### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) used for the attack.

##### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) and [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

##### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike).

##### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Path of the Wild Heart

*Walk in Community with the Animal World*

Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.

##### Level 3: Animal Speaker

You can cast the [Beast Sense](/spells/2618914-beast-sense) and [Speak with Animals](/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.

##### Level 3: Rage of the Wilds

***Bear.*** While your Rage is active, you have Resistance to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.

***Eagle.*** When you activate your Rage, you can take the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) actions as part of that Bonus Action. While your Rage is active, you can take a Bonus Action to take both of those actions.

***Wolf.*** While your Rage is active, your allies have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against any enemy of yours within 5 feet of you.

##### Level 6: Aspect of the Wilds

You gain one of the following options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your choice.

***Owl.*** You have [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

***Panther.*** You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

***Salmon.*** You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

##### Level 10: Nature Speaker

Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.

***Falcon.*** While your Rage is active, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed if you aren’t wearing any armor.

***Lion.*** While your Rage is active, any of your enemies within 5 feet of you have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against targets other than you or another Barbarian who has this option active.

***Ram.*** While your Rage is active, you can cause a Large or smaller creature to have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition when you hit it with a melee attack.

#### Path of the World Tree

*Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse*

Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree’s magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.

##### Level 3: Vitality of the Tree

Your Rage taps into the life force of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits.

***Vitality Surge.*** When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Barbarian level.

***Life-Giving Force.*** At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints). To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your Rage ends, they vanish.

##### Level 6: Branches of the Tree

Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.

##### Level 10: Battering Roots

During your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with any Melee weapon that has the [Heavy](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Heavy) or [Versatile](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Versatile) property, as tendrils of the World Tree extend from you. When you hit with such a weapon on your turn, you can activate the [Push](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Push) or [Topple](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Topple) mastery property in addition to a different mastery property you’re using with that weapon.

##### Level 14: Travel along the Tree

When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

In addition, once per Rage, you can increase the range of that teleport to 150 feet. When you do so, you can also bring up to six willing creatures who are within 10 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.

#### Path of the Zealot

*Rage in Ecstatic Union with a God*

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of divine union that infuses them with power. They are often allies to the priests and other followers of their god or pantheon.

##### Level 3: Divine Fury

You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.

##### Level 3: Warrior of the Gods

A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the fight. You have a pool of four d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

The pool’s maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).

##### Level 6: Fanatical Focus

Once per active Rage, if you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and you must use the new roll.

##### Level 10: Zealous Presence

As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 14: Rage of the Gods

When you activate your Rage, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

While in this form, you gain the benefits below.

***Flight.*** You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.

***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage.

***Revivification.*** When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Rage to instead change the target’s Hit Points to a number equal to your Barbarian level.

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

***Using Bardic Inspiration.*** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

***Number of Uses.*** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***At Higher Levels.*** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the [Bard spell list](#BardSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [Dancing Lights](/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) and [Vicious Mockery](/spells/2619216-vicious-mockery) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures).

***Spell Slots.*** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Color Spray](/spells/2618978-color-spray), [Dissonant Whispers](/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), and [Healing Word](/spells/2619143-healing-word) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a **[Musical Instrument](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MusicalInstrumentVaries)** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 2: Expertise

You gain [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) (see the [rules glossary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/rules-glossary#Expertise)) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. [Performance](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Persuasion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

> ### A Bard’s Repertoire
> 
> Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks?

When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all?

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The [College of Dance](#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](#CollegeofValor) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the [Bard](#BardSpellList), [Cleric](#ClericSpellList), [Druid](#DruidSpellList), and [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the [Power Word Heal](/spells/2618880-power-word-heal) and [Power Word Kill](/spells/2618886-power-word-kill) spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

### Bard Spell List

This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

### Bard Subclasses

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to preserve their traditions. This section presents the [College of Dance](#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](#CollegeofValor) subclasses.

#### College of Dance

*Move in Harmony with the Cosmos*

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can’t be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.

##### Level 3: Dazzling Footwork

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits.

***Dance Virtuoso.*** You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any Charisma ([Performance](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check you make that involves you dancing.

***Unarmored Defense.*** Your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

***Agile Strikes.*** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.

***Bardic Damage.*** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike’s normal damage. This roll doesn’t expend the die.

##### Level 6: Inspiring Movement

When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.

None of this feature’s movement provokes [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### Level 6: Tandem Footwork

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don’t have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to Initiative equal to the number rolled.

##### Level 14: Leading Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### College of Glamour

*Weave Beguiling Fey Magic*

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

##### Level 3: Beguiling Magic

You always have the [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Mirror Image](/spells/2619060-mirror-image) spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).

##### Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration

You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### Level 6: Mantle of Majesty

You always have the [Command](/spells/2618985-command) spell prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you cast *Command* without expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) ends. During this time, you can cast *Command* as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.

Any creature [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you automatically fails its saving throw against the *Command* you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action required).

##### Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty

As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### College of Lore

*Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge*

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

##### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

##### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

##### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the [Cleric](#ClericSpellList), [Druid](#DruidSpellList), or [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell list or any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures).

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

##### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.

#### College of Valor

*Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes*

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

##### Level 3: Combat Inspiration

You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.

***Defense.*** When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

***Offense.*** Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack’s damage against the target.

##### Level 3: Martial Training

You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

##### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

##### Level 14: Battle Magic

After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the [Cleric spell list](#ClericSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance), [Sacred Flame](/spells/2618967-sacred-flame), and [Thaumaturgy](/spells/2619174-thaumaturgy) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures).

***Spell Slots.*** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. [Bless](/spells/2618933-bless), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), and [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a [Holy Symbol](/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

***Protector.*** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

***Thaumaturge.*** You know one extra cantrip from the [Cleric spell list](#ClericSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Religion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures).

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

***Divine Spark.*** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

***Turn Undead.*** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The [Life Domain](#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](#WarDomain) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

#### Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).

***Potent Spellcasting.*** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

***Divine Strike.*** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

***Potent Spellcasting.*** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 [Long Rests](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Cleric Spell List

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

### Cleric Subclasses

A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the [Life Domain](#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](#WarDomain) subclasses.

#### Life Domain

*Soothe the Hurts of the World*

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

##### Level 3: Disciple of Life

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### Level 3: Life Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Life Domain Spells


| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Aid](/spells/2618845-aid), [Bless](/spells/2618933-bless), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Lesser Restoration](/spells/2619016-lesser-restoration) |
| 5 | [Mass Healing Word](/spells/2619028-mass-healing-word), [Revivify](/spells/2618956-revivify) |
| 7 | [Aura of Life](/spells/2618884-aura-of-life), [Death Ward](/spells/2619085-death-ward) |
| 9 | [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration), [Mass Cure Wounds](/spells/2619026-mass-cure-wounds) |

##### Level 3: Preserve Life

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose [Bloodied](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied) creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

##### Level 6: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

#### Light Domain

*Bring Light to Banish Darkness*

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement.

##### Level 3: Light Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Light Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Light Domain Spells


| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Burning Hands](/spells/2618946-burning-hands), [Faerie Fire](/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), [Scorching Ray](/spells/2619005-scorching-ray), [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility) |
| 5 | [Daylight](/spells/2619083-daylight), [Fireball](/spells/2618887-fireball) |
| 7 | [Arcane Eye](/spells/2618863-arcane-eye), [Wall of Fire](/spells/2619107-wall-of-fire) |
| 9 | [Flame Strike](/spells/2618920-flame-strike), [Scrying](/spells/2619007-scrying) |

##### Level 3: Radiance of the Dawn

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from yourself. Any magical [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness)—such as that created by the [Darkness](/spells/2619080-darkness) spell—in that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


##### Level 3: Warding Flare

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to impose [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 6: Improved Warding Flare

You regain all expended uses of your Warding Flare when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, whenever you use Warding Flare, you can give the target of the triggering attack a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 2d6 plus your Wisdom modifier.

##### Level 17: Corona of Light

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 60-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the Bright Light have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Trickery Domain

*Make Mischief and Challenge Authority*

The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.

Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.

##### Level 3: Blessing of the Trickster

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 30 feet of yourself to have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Dexterity ([Stealth](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. This blessing lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) or you use this feature again.

##### Level 3: Trickery Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Trickery Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Trickery Domain Spells


| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Disguise Self](/spells/2619102-disguise-self), [Invisibility](/spells/2619116-invisibility), [Pass without Trace](/spells/2618849-pass-without-trace) |
| 5 | [Hypnotic Pattern](/spells/2619168-hypnotic-pattern), [Nondetection](/spells/2619122-nondetection) |
| 7 | [Confusion](/spells/2619043-confusion), [Dimension Door](/spells/2619100-dimension-door) |
| 9 | [Dominate Person](/spells/2619148-dominate-person), [Modify Memory](/spells/2619109-modify-memory) |


##### Level 3: Invoke Duplicity

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. The illusion is animated and mimics your expressions and gestures. While it persists, you gain the following benefits.

***Cast Spells.*** You can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses.

***Distract.*** When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

***Move.*** As a Bonus Action, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is within 120 feet of yourself.

##### Level 6: Trickster’s Transposition

Whenever you take the Bonus Action to create or move the illusion of your Invoke Duplicity, you can teleport, swapping places with the illusion.

##### Level 17: Improved Duplicity

The illusion of your Invoke Duplicity has grown more powerful in the following ways.

***Shared Distraction.*** When you and your allies make attack rolls against a creature within 5 feet of the illusion, the attack rolls have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

***Healing Illusion.*** When the illusion ends, you or a creature of your choice within 5 feet of it regains a number of Hit Points equal to your Cleric level.

#### War Domain

*Inspire Valor and Smite Foes*

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.

Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

##### Level 3: Guided Strike

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus, potentially causing it to hit. When you use this feature to benefit another creature’s attack roll, you must take a Reaction to do so.

##### Level 3: War Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### War Domain Spells


| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), [Magic Weapon](/spells/2619024-magic-weapon), [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith), [Spiritual Weapon](/spells/2619081-spiritual-weapon) |
| 5 | [Crusader’s Mantle](/spells/2619057-crusaders-mantle), [Spirit Guardians](/spells/2619078-spirit-guardians) |
| 7 | [Fire Shield](/spells/2618894-fire-shield), [Freedom of Movement](/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement) |
| 9 | [Hold Monster](/spells/2619152-hold-monster), [Steel Wind Strike](/spells/2619087-steel-wind-strike) |

##### Level 3: War Priest

As a Bonus Action, you can make one attack with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 6: War God’s Blessing

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) or [Spiritual Weapon](/spells/2619081-spiritual-weapon) rather than expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell in this way, the spell doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). Instead the spell lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you cast that spell again, have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die.

##### Level 17: Avatar of Battle

You gain Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.

Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the [Druid spell list](#DruidSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. [Druidcraft](/spells/2619158-druidcraft) and [Produce Flame](/spells/2618901-produce-flame) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. [Animal Friendship](/spells/2618847-animal-friendship), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Faerie Fire](/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), and [Thunderwave](/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a [Druidic Focus](/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the [Speak with Animals](/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

***Magician.*** You know one extra cantrip from the [Druid spell list](#DruidSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Nature](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

***Warden.*** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

***Number of Uses.*** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the [Druid Features table](#DruidFeatures).

***Known Forms.*** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see [appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks/) for stat block options). The [Rat](/monsters/4775836-rat), [Riding Horse](/monsters/4775839-riding-horse), [Spider](/monsters/4775844-spider), and [Wolf](/monsters/4775850-wolf) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the *Monster Manual* or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.


##### Beast Shapes


| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4 | 1/4 | No |
| 4 | 6 | 1/2 | No |
| 8 | 8 | 1 | Yes |

***Rules While Shape-Shifted.*** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Druid level.

**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**No Spellcasting.** You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.

**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.

#### Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the [Find Familiar](/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The [Circle of the Land](#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](#CircleoftheStars) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

***Potent Spellcasting.*** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.

***Primal Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).

#### Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

***Potent Spellcasting.*** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.

***Primal Strike.*** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

***Evergreen Wild Shape.*** Whenever you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

***Nature Magician.*** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Longevity.*** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

### Druid Spell List

This section presents the Druid spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Druid Subclasses

A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they call circles. This section presents the [Circle of the Land](#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](#CircleoftheStars) subclasses.

#### Circle of the Land

*Celebrate Connection to the Natural World*

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

##### Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level and lower prepared.

| 7 | [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph) |
| 9 | [Insect Plague](/spells/2619183-insect-plague) |

##### Level 3: Land’s Aid

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

##### Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

##### Level 10: Nature’s Ward

You are immune to the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.


##### Nature’s Ward


| Land Type | Resistance |
| --- | --- |
| Arid | Fire |
| Polar | Cold |
| Temperate | Lightning |
| Tropical | Poison |

##### Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or die. You and your allies have [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

#### Circle of the Moon

*Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds*

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.

##### Level 3: Circle Forms

You can channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.

***Challenge Rating.*** The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).

***Armor Class.*** Until you leave the form, your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier if that total is higher than the Beast’s AC.

***Temporary Hit Points.*** You gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to three times your Druid level.

##### Level 3: Circle of the Moon Spells

When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

In addition, you can cast the spells from this feature while you’re in a Wild Shape form.


##### Circle of the Moon Spells


| Druid Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Moonbeam](/spells/2619134-moonbeam), [Starry Wisp](/spells/2618840-starry-wisp) |
| 5 | [Conjure Animals](/spells/2619044-conjure-animals) |
| 7 | [Fount of Moonlight](/spells/2618835-fount-of-moonlight) |
| 9 | [Mass Cure Wounds](/spells/2619026-mass-cure-wounds) |

##### Level 6: Improved Circle Forms

While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the following benefits.

***Lunar Radiance.*** Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage. You make this choice each time you hit with those attacks.

***Increased Toughness.*** You can add your Wisdom modifier to your Constitution saving throws.

##### Level 10: Moonlight Step

You magically transport yourself, reappearing amid a burst of moonlight. As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the next attack roll you make before the end of this turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also regain uses by expending a level 2+ spell slot for each use you want to restore (no action required).

##### Level 14: Lunar Form

The power of the moon suffuses you, granting you the following benefits.

***Improved Lunar Radiance.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d10 Radiant damage to a target you hit with a Wild Shape form’s attack.

***Shared Moonlight.*** Whenever you use Moonlight Step, you can also teleport one willing creature. That creature must be within 10 feet of you, and you teleport it to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of your destination space.

#### Circle of the Sea

*Become One with Tides and Storms*

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature’s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

##### Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells

When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Circle of the Sea Spells


| Druid Level | Prepared Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Fog Cloud](/spells/2618910-fog-cloud), [Gust of Wind](/spells/2619137-gust-of-wind), [Ray of Frost](/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost), [Shatter](/spells/2619017-shatter), [Thunderwave](/spells/2619184-thunderwave) |

| 7 | [Control Water](/spells/2619070-control-water), [Ice Storm](/spells/2619178-ice-storm) |
| 9 | [Conjure Elemental](/spells/2619047-conjure-elemental), [Hold Monster](/spells/2619152-hold-monster) |

##### Level 3: Wrath of the Sea

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

##### Level 6: Aquatic Affinity

The size of the [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) created by your Wrath of the Sea increases to 10 feet.

In addition, you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

##### Level 10: Stormborn

Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active, as detailed below.

***Flight.*** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.

***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Cold, Lightning, and Thunder damage.

##### Level 14: Oceanic Gift

Instead of manifesting the [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.

#### Circle of the Stars

*Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations*

The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos.

##### Level 3: Star Map

You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) spells prepared, and you can cast *Guiding Bolt* without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.


##### Star Map


| 1d6 | Map Form |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A scroll bearing depictions of constellations |
| 2 | A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it |
| 3 | An owlbear hide tooled with stellar symbols |
| 4 | A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover |
| 5 | A crystal engraved with starry patterns |
| 6 | A glass disk etched with constellations |

##### Level 3: Starry Form

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

***Archer.*** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

***Chalice.*** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

***Dragon.*** A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

##### Level 6: Cosmic Omen

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

***Weal (Even).*** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

***Woe (Odd).*** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

##### Level 10: Twinkling Constellations

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

##### Level 14: Full of Stars

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

#### Level 1: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats)). [Defense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#Defense) is recommended.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

#### Level 1: Second Wind

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the [Fighter Features table](#FighterFeatures).

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the [Fighter Features table](#FighterFeatures).

#### Level 2: Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

#### Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

#### Level 3: Fighter Subclass

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The [Battle Master](#BattleMaster), [Champion](#Champion), [Eldritch Knight](#EldritchKnight), and [Psi Warrior](#PsiWarrior) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.

#### Level 9: Tactical Master

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the [Push](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Push), [Sap](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Sap), or [Slow](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Slow) property for that attack.

#### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 13: Studied Attacks

You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Combat Prowess](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofCombatProwess) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

### Fighter Subclasses

A Fighter subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Battle Master](#BattleMaster), [Champion](#Champion), [Eldritch Knight](#EldritchKnight), and [Psi Warrior](#PsiWarrior) subclasses.

#### Battle Master

*Master Sophisticated Battle Maneuvers*

Battle Masters are students of the art of battle, learning martial techniques passed down through generations. The most accomplished Battle Masters are well-rounded figures who combine their carefully honed combat skills with academic study in the fields of history, theory, and the arts.

##### Level 3: Combat Superiority

Your experience on the battlefield has refined your fighting techniques. You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.

***Maneuvers.*** You learn three maneuvers of your choice from the [“Maneuver Options”](#ManeuverOptions) section later in this subclass’s description. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

***Superiority Dice.*** You have four Superiority Dice, which are d8s. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).

***Saving Throws.*** If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus.

##### Level 3: Student of War

As a Bonus Action, you can discern certain strengths and weaknesses of a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself; you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore a use of the feature by expending one Superiority Die (no action required).

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of yourself as your target.

##### Menacing Attack

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to frighten the target. Add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

##### Parry

When another creature damages you with a melee attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one Superiority Die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your Superiority Die plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

##### Precision Attack

When you miss with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die, roll that die, and add it to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit.

##### Pushing Attack

When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to drive the target back.

##### Rally

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion. Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).

##### Riposte

When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one Superiority Die to make a melee attack roll with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) against the creature. If you hit, add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage.

When you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to damage another creature. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your Superiority Die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

##### Tactical Assessment

When you make an Intelligence ([History](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check or a Wisdom ([Insight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check, you can expend one Superiority Die and add that die to the ability check.

#### Eldritch Knight

*Support Combat Skills with Arcane Magic*

Eldritch Knights combine the martial mastery common to all Fighters with a careful study of magic. Their spells both complement and extend their combat skills, providing additional protection to shore up their armor and also allowing them to engage many foes at once with explosive magic.

##### Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) (see that class’s section for its list). [Ray of Frost](/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) and [Shocking Grasp](/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots.** The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


##### Eldritch Knight Spellcasting

| 19 | 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 20 | 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the [Wizard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList). [Burning Hands](/spells/2618946-burning-hands), [Jump](/spells/2618991-jump), and [Shield](/spells/2619019-shield) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

##### Level 3: War Bond

You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest). The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to which someone else is attuned.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a Bonus Action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

##### Level 7: War Magic

When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action.

##### Level 10: Eldritch Strike

You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s ability to withstand your spells. When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, that creature has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

##### Level 15: Arcane Charge

When you use your Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

##### Level 18: Improved War Magic

When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can replace two of the attacks with a casting of one of your level 1 or level 2 Wizard spells that has a casting time of an action.

#### Psi Warrior

*Augment Physical Might with Psionic Power*

Psi Warriors awaken the power of their minds to augment their physical might. They harness this psionic power to infuse their weapon strikes, lash out with telekinetic energy, and create barriers of mental force.

##### Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior Energy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.


##### Psi Warrior Energy Dice


| Fighter Level | Die Size | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | D6 | 4 |
| 5 | D8 | 6 |
| 9 | D8 | 8 |
| 11 | D10 | 8 |
| 13 | D10 | 10 |
| 17 | D12 | 12 |

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Protective Field.*** When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.


***Psionic Strike.*** You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of yourself with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, rolling it and dealing Force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

***Telekinetic Movement.*** You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself; the target must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or from your hand.

Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 7: Telekinetic Adept

You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.

***Psi-Powered Leap.*** As a Bonus Action, you gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this Bonus Action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

***Telekinetic Thrust.*** When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Intelligence modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you can give the target the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition or transport it up to 10 feet horizontally.

##### Level 10: Guarded Mind

You have Resistance to Psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn with the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) and end every effect on yourself giving you those conditions.

##### Level 15: Bulwark of Force

You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a Bonus Action, you can choose creatures, including yourself, within 30 feet of yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures has [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 18: Telekinetic Master

You always have the [Telekinesis](/spells/2619157-telekinesis) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

#### Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons, which are the following:

* Simple Melee weapons
* Martial Melee weapons that have the [Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light) property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

***Bonus Unarmed Strike.*** You can make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

***Martial Arts Die.*** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

***Dexterous Attacks.*** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### Level 2: Monk’s Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Monk Features table](#MonkFeatures).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

***Flurry of Blows.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

***Patient Defense.*** You can take the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) actions as a Bonus Action.

***Step of the Wind.*** You can take the [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Level 2: Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the [Monk Features table](#MonkFeatures).

#### Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

#### Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The [Warrior of Mercy](#WarriorofMercy), [Warrior of Shadow](#WarriorofShadow), [Warrior of the Elements](#WarrioroftheElements), and [Warrior of the Open Hand](#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 4: Slow Fall

You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Stunning Strike

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### Level 7: Evasion

When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.

You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

#### Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.

***Flurry of Blows.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with it instead of two.

***Patient Defense.*** When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

***Step of the Wind.*** When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t provoke [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition).

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give you levels of [Exhaustion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

#### Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

#### Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

#### Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

#### Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Body and Mind

You have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Monk Subclasses

A Monk subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Warrior of Mercy](#WarriorofMercy), [Warrior of Shadow](#WarriorofShadow), [Warrior of the Elements](#WarrioroftheElements), and [Warrior of the Open Hand](#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclasses.

#### Warrior of Mercy

*Manipulate Forces of Life and Death*

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death.

##### Level 3: Hand of Harm

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

##### Level 3: Hand of Healing

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of Hit Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.

##### Level 3: Implements of Mercy

You gain proficiency in the [Insight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Medicine](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skills and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.

##### Level 6: Physician’s Touch

Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.

***Hand of Harm.*** When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

***Hand of Healing.*** When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), or [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition).

##### Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm

When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an Unarmed Strike with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), and [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Warrior of Shadow

*Harness Shadow Power for Stealth and Subterfuge*

Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and subterfuge, harnessing the power of the Shadowfell. They are at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around themselves to hide, leap from shadow to shadow, and take on a wraithlike form.

##### Level 3: Shadow Arts

You have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits.

***Darkness.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the [Darkness](/spells/2619080-darkness) spell without spell components. You can see within the spell’s area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can move its area of [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) to a space within 60 feet of yourself at the start of each of your turns.

***Darkvision.*** You gain [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

***Shadowy Figments.*** You know the [Minor Illusion](/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

##### Level 6: Shadow Step

While entirely within [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness), you can use a Bonus Action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in Dim Light or Darkness. You then have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the next melee attack you make before the end of the current turn.

##### Level 11: Improved Shadow Step

You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When you use your Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement that you must start and end in [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) for that use of the feature. As part of this Bonus Action, you can make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) immediately after you teleport.

##### Level 17: Cloak of Shadows

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action while entirely within [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness), you can expend 3 Focus Points to shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or until you end your turn in [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight). While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following benefits.

***Invisibility.*** You have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition.

***Partially Incorporeal.*** You can move through occupied spaces as if they were [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain). If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you were in.

***Shadow Flurry.*** You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus Points.

#### Warrior of the Elements

*Wield Strikes and Bursts of Elemental Power*

Warriors of the Elements tap into the power of the Elemental Planes. Harnessing their supernatural focus, these Monks momentarily tame the energy of the Elemental Chaos to empower themselves in and out of battle.

##### Level 3: Elemental Attunement

At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.

***Reach.*** When you make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

***Elemental Strikes.*** Whenever you hit with your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.

##### Level 3: Manipulate Elements

You know the [Elementalism](/spells/2618834-elementalism) spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

##### Level 6: Elemental Burst

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 2 Focus Points to cause elemental energy to burst in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on a point within 120 feet of yourself. Choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

Each creature in the Sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

##### Level 11: Stride of the Elements

While your Elemental Attunement is active, you also have a Fly Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

##### Level 17: Elemental Epitome

While your Elemental Attunement is active, you also gain the following benefits.

***Damage Resistance.*** You gain Resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. At the start of each of your turns, you can change this choice.

***Destructive Stride.*** When you use your Step of the Wind, your Speed increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn. For that duration, any creature of your choice takes damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you enter a space within 5 feet of it. The damage type is your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Empowered Strikes.*** Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). The extra damage is the same type dealt by that strike.

#### Warrior of the Open Hand

*Master Unarmed Combat Techniques*

Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.

##### Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

***Addle.*** The target can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of its next turn.

***Push.*** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

***Topple.*** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

##### Level 6: Wholeness of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.

##### Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

#### Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [Paladin spell list](#PaladinSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Spell Slots.*** The [Paladin Features table](#PaladinFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+***. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. [Heroism](/spells/2619151-heroism) and [Searing Smite](/spells/2619009-searing-smite) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Paladin Features table](#PaladinFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a [Holy Symbol](/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats) for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

***Blessed Warrior.*** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a [list of Cleric spells](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList)). [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Sacred Flame](/spells/2618967-sacred-flame) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 2: Paladin’s Smite

You always have the [Divine Smite](/spells/2618833-divine-smite) spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

#### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

***Divine Sense.*** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](/spells/2619138-hallow) spell.

#### Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The [Oath of Devotion](#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](#OathofVengeance) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

> ### Breaking Your Oath
> 
> A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
> 
> A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.
> 
> If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the [Find Steed](/spells/2618879-find-steed) spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


#### Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition). You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect).

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Truesight](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofsenseTruesightsense) is recommended.

### Paladin Subclasses

A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Oath of Devotion](#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](#OathofVengeance) subclasses.

Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

#### Oath of Devotion

*Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order*

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:

* Let your word be your promise.
* Protect the weak and never fear to act.
* Let your honorable deeds be an example.

##### Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of Devotion Spells


| Paladin Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Protection from Evil and Good](/spells/2618912-protection-from-evil-and-good), [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) |
| 5 | [Aid](/spells/2618845-aid), [Zone of Truth](/spells/2619221-zone-of-truth) |
| 9 | [Beacon of Hope](/spells/2618911-beacon-of-hope), [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) |
| 13 | [Freedom of Movement](/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement), [Guardian of Faith](/spells/2619135-guardian-of-faith) |
| 17 | [Commune](/spells/2618987-commune), [Flame Strike](/spells/2618920-flame-strike) |

##### Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the weapon.

##### Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

##### Level 15: Smite of Protection

Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast [Divine Smite](/spells/2618833-divine-smite), you and your allies have [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in your Aura of Protection. The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.

##### Level 20: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

***Holy Ward.*** You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any saving throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an Undead.

***Radiant Damage.*** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

***Sunlight.*** The aura is filled with [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) that is sunlight.

#### Oath of Glory

*Strive for the Heights of Heroism*

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions, so they’re all ready when destiny calls.

These paladins share the following tenets:

* Endeavor to be known by your deeds.
* Face hardships with courage.
* Inspire others to strive for glory.

##### Level 3: Inspiring Smite

Immediately after you cast [Divine Smite](/spells/2618833-divine-smite), you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and distribute [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, which can include you. The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals 2d8 plus your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

##### Level 3: Oath of Glory Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Oath of Glory Spells


| Paladin Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), [Heroism](/spells/2619151-heroism) |
| 5 | [Enhance Ability](/spells/2619165-enhance-ability), [Magic Weapon](/spells/2619024-magic-weapon) |
| 9 | [Haste](/spells/2619141-haste), [Protection from Energy](/spells/2618908-protection-from-energy) |
| 13 | [Compulsion](/spells/2619041-compulsion), [Freedom of Movement](/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement) |
| 17 | [Legend Lore](/spells/2619010-legend-lore), [Yolande’s Regal Presence](/spells/2618842-yolandes-regal-presence) |


##### Level 3: Peerless Athlete

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) and Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks, and the distance of your [Long](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongJump) and [High Jumps](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HighJump) increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

##### Level 7: Aura of Alacrity

Your Speed increases by 10 feet.

In addition, whenever an ally enters your Aura of Protection for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, the ally’s Speed increases by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

##### Level 15: Glorious Defense

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to grant a bonus to the target’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the attacker as part of this Reaction if the attacker is within your weapon’s range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 20: Living Legend

You can empower yourself with the legends—whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

***Charismatic.*** You are blessed with an otherworldly presence and have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on all Charisma checks.

***Saving Throw Reroll.*** If you fail a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

***Unerring Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.

#### Oath of the Ancients

*Preserve Life and Light in the World*

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves. Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.

These paladins share the following tenets:

* Kindle the light of hope.
* Shelter life.
* Delight in art and laughter.

##### Level 3: Nature’s Wrath

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to conjure spectral vines around nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of yourself must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition for 1 minute. A Restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### Level 3: Oath of the Ancients Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Ancients Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


#### Oath of the Ancients Spells


| Paladin Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Ensnaring Strike](/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike), [Speak with Animals](/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) |
| 5 | [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step), [Moonbeam](/spells/2619134-moonbeam) |
| 9 | [Plant Growth](/spells/2618869-plant-growth), [Protection from Energy](/spells/2618908-protection-from-energy) |
| 13 | [Ice Storm](/spells/2619178-ice-storm), [Stoneskin](/spells/2619095-stoneskin) |
| 17 | [Commune with Nature](/spells/2618989-commune-with-nature), [Tree Stride](/spells/2619197-tree-stride) |

##### Level 7: Aura of Warding

Ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward, blunting energy from beyond the Material Plane; you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage while in your Aura of Protection.


##### Level 15: Undying Sentinel

When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to three times your Paladin level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Additionally, you can’t be aged magically, and you cease visibly aging.

##### Level 20: Elder Champion

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with primal power, granting the benefits below for 1 minute or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

***Diminish Defiance.*** Enemies in the aura have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws against your spells and Channel Divinity options.

***Regeneration.*** At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 Hit Points.

***Swift Spells.*** Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can cast it using a Bonus Action instead.

#### Oath of Vengeance

*Punish Evildoers at Any Cost*

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.


These paladins share the following tenets:

* Show the wicked no mercy.
* Fight injustice and its causes.
* Aid those harmed by injustice.

##### Level 3: Oath of Vengeance Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Oath of Vengeance Spells


| Paladin Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Bane](/spells/2618900-bane), [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) |

| 17 | [Hold Monster](/spells/2619152-hold-monster), [Scrying](/spells/2619007-scrying) |

##### Level 3: Vow of Enmity

When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).


##### Level 7: Relentless Avenger

Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an [Opportunity Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack), you can reduce the creature’s Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

##### Level 15: Soul of Vengeance

Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to make a melee attack against that creature if it’s within range.

##### Level 20: Avenging Angel

As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

***Flight.*** You sprout spectral wings on your back, have a Fly Speed of 60 feet, and can hover.

***Frightful Aura.*** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in your Aura of Protection, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](#RangerSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Spell Slots.*** The [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+***. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a [Druidic Focus](/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

#### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures).

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

#### Level 2: Deft Explorer

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

***Expertise.*** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in that skill.

***Languages.*** You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in [chapter 2](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character#ChooseLanguages).

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats)). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

***Druidic Warrior.*** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a [list of Druid spells](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList)). [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Starry Wisp](/spells/2618840-starry-wisp) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

#### Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice.The [Beast Master](#BeastMaster), [Fey Wanderer](#FeyWanderer), [Gloom Stalker](#GloomStalker), and [Hunter](#Hunter) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 6: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

#### Level 9: Expertise

Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in those skills.

#### Level 10: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

***Temporary Hit Points.*** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can give yourself a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Decrease Exhaustion.*** Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), your [Exhaustion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level, if any, decreases by 1.

#### Level 13: Relentless Hunter

Taking damage can’t break your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark).

#### Level 14: Nature’s Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

#### Level 17: Precise Hunter

Your connection to the forces of nature grants you [Blindsight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Blindsight) with a range of 30 feet.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Foe Slayer

The damage die of your [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) is a d10 rather than a d6.

### Ranger Subclasses

A Ranger subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Beast Master](#BeastMaster), [Fey Wanderer](#FeyWanderer), [Gloom Stalker](#GloomStalker), and [Hunter](#Hunter) subclasses.

#### Beast Master

*Bond with a Primal Beast*

A Beast Master forms a mystical bond with a special animal, drawing on primal magic and a deep connection to the natural world.

##### Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: **[Beast of the Land](#BeastoftheLand)**, **[Beast of the Sea](#BeastoftheSea)**, or **[Beast of the Sky](#BeastoftheSky)**. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is [Friendly](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.

***The Beast in Combat.*** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.

***Restoring or Replacing the Beast.*** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of your [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

##### Level 15: Share Spells

When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Primal Companion beast with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

#### Fey Wanderer

*Wield Fey Mirth and Fury*

A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey or a location in the Feywild that transformed you. However you gained fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer. Your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

##### Level 3: Dreadful Strikes

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic drawn from the murky hollows of the Feywild.

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 1: Sneak Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the roll and the attack uses a [Finesse](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse) or a [Ranged](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Range) weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.

You don’t need [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, and you don’t have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the attack roll.

The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the [Rogue Features table](#RogueFeatures).

#### Level 1: Thieves’ Cant

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in [chapter 2](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character#ChooseLanguages).

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

#### Level 2: Cunning Action

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction), [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction), or [Hide](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction).

#### Level 3: Rogue Subclass

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The [Arcane Trickster](#ArcaneTrickster), [Assassin](#Assassin), [Soulknife](#Soulknife), and [Thief](#Thief) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Rogue level or lower.

#### Level 3: Steady Aim

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

#### Level 5: Cunning Strike

You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

***Poison (Cost: 1d6).*** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

To use this effect, you must have a [Poisoner’s Kit](/equipment/492-poisoners-kit) on your person.

***Trip (Cost: 1d6).*** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

***Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).*** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).

#### Level 7: Evasion

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 7: Reliable Talent

Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

#### Level 14: Devious Strikes

You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

***Daze (Cost: 2d6).*** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.

***Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).*** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Obscure (Cost: 3d6).*** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn.

#### Level 15: Slippery Mind

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

#### Level 18: Elusive

You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) against you unless you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of the Night Spirit](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonoftheNightSpirit) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Stroke of Luck

You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can turn the roll into a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Rogue Subclasses

A Rogue subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Arcane Trickster](#ArcaneTrickster), [Assassin](#Assassin), [Soulknife](#Soulknife), and [Thief](#Thief) subclasses.

#### Arcane Trickster

*Enhance Stealth with Arcane Spells*

Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with spells, learning magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters.

##### Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.

***Cantrips.*** You know three cantrips: [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand) and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list](#WizardSpellList) (see that class’s section for its list). [Mind Sliver](/spells/2619037-mind-sliver) and [Minor Illusion](/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand), with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

***Spell Slots.*** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

| 20 | 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Disguise Self](/spells/2619102-disguise-self), and [Fog Cloud](/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

##### Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain

When you cast [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand), you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition). You can control the hand as a Bonus Action, and through it, you can make Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

##### Level 9: Magical Ambush

If you have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.

##### Level 13: Versatile Trickster

You gain the ability to distract targets with your [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand). When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

##### Level 17: Spell Thief

You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can’t cast it until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Assassin

*Practice the Grim Art of Death*

An Assassin’s training focuses on using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities of this subclass are equally useful for adventurers facing a variety of monstrous enemies.

##### Level 3: Assassinate

You’re adept at ambushing a target, granting you the following benefits.

***Initiative.*** You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Initiative rolls.

***Surprising Strikes.*** During the first round of each combat, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon’s type equal to your Rogue level.

##### Level 3: Assassin’s Tools

You gain a [Disguise Kit](/equipment/542-disguise-kit) and a [Poisoner’s Kit](/equipment/492-poisoners-kit), and you have proficiency with them.

##### Level 9: Infiltration Expertise

You are expert at the following techniques that aid your infiltrations.

***Masterful Mimicry.*** You can unerringly mimic another person’s speech, handwriting, or both if you have spent at least 1 hour studying them.

***Roving Aim.*** Your Speed isn’t reduced to 0 by using Steady Aim.

##### Level 13: Envenom Weapons

When you use the Poison option of your Cunning Strike, the target also takes 2d6 Poison damage whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage ignores Resistance to Poison damage.

##### Level 17: Death Strike

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first round of a combat, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus), or the attack’s damage is doubled against the target.

#### Soulknife

*Strike Foes with Psionic Blades*

A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

##### Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.


##### Soulknife Energy Dice


| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | D6 | 4 |
| 5 | D8 | 6 |
| 9 | D8 | 8 |
| 11 | D10 | 8 |
| 13 | D10 | 10 |
| 17 | D12 | 12 |


Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Psi-Bolstered Knack.*** If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.

***Psychic Whispers.*** You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).

The first time you use this power after each [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you don’t expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

##### Level 3: Psychic Blades

You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action or make an [Opportunity Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack), you can manifest a Psychic Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:

**Weapon Category:** Simple Melee

**Damage on a Hit:** 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll

**Properties:** [Finesse](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse), [Thrown](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) (range 60/120 feet)

**Mastery:** [Vex](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Vex) (you can use this property, and it doesn’t count against the number of properties you can use with [Weapon Mastery](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties))

The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.

##### Level 9: Soul Blades

You can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.

***Homing Strikes.*** If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

***Psychic Teleportation.*** As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

##### Level 13: Psychic Veil

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you gain the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 17: Rend Mind

You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Thief

*Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer*

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.


##### Level 3: Fast Hands

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.

***Sleight of Hand.*** Make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.

***Use an Object.*** Take the [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, or take the [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to use a magic item that requires that action.

##### Level 3: Second-Story Work

You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.

***Climber.*** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

***Jumper.*** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

##### Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

***Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6).*** If you have the [Hide](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action’s [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition, this attack doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the turn behind [Three-Quarters Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) or [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover).

##### Level 13: Use Magic Device

You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

***Attunement.*** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

***Charges.*** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

***Scrolls.*** You can use any [Spell Scroll](/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

##### Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the [Sorcerer spell list](#SorcererSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. [Light](/spells/2618996-light), [Prestidigitation](/spells/2618893-prestidigitation), [Shocking Grasp](/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp), and [Sorcerous Burst](/spells/2618839-sorcerous-burst) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures).

***Spell Slots.*** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. [Burning Hands](/spells/2618946-burning-hands) and [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

* The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
* You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures). You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

***Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.*** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).

***Creating Spell Slots.*** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


##### Creating Spell Slots


| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | Min. Sorcerer Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 5 | 5 |
| 4 | 6 | 7 |
| 5 | 7 | 9 |

#### Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “[Metamagic Options](#MetamagicOptions)” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The [Aberrant Sorcery](#AberrantSorcery), [Clockwork Sorcery](#ClockworkSorcery), [Draconic Sorcery](#DraconicSorcery), and [Wild Magic Sorcery](#WildMagicSorcery) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your [Metamagic options](#MetamagicOptions) on each spell you cast.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

#### Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your [Metamagic feature](#Level2Metamagic). The options are presented in alphabetical order.

##### Careful Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### Distant Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.

##### Empowered Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### Extended Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

##### Heightened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saves against the spell.

##### Quickened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

##### Seeking Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### Subtle Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

##### Transmuted Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

##### Twinned Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, such as [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

### Sorcerer Spell List

This section presents the Sorcerer spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Sorcerer Subclasses

A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Aberrant Sorcery](#AberrantSorcery), [Clockwork Sorcery](#ClockworkSorcery), [Draconic Sorcery](#DraconicSorcery), and [Wild Magic Sorcery](#WildMagicSorcery) subclasses.

#### Aberrant Sorcery

*Wield Unnatural Psionic Power*

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.

##### Level 3: Psionic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Psionic Spells


| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Arms of Hadar](/spells/2618871-arms-of-hadar), [Calm Emotions](/spells/2618959-calm-emotions), [Detect Thoughts](/spells/2619099-detect-thoughts), [Dissonant Whispers](/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), [Mind Sliver](/spells/2619037-mind-sliver) |
| 5 | [Hunger of Hadar](/spells/2619162-hunger-of-hadar), [Sending](/spells/2619015-sending) |
| 7 | [Evard’s Black Tentacles](/spells/2619187-evards-black-tentacles), [Summon Aberration](/spells/2619105-summon-aberration) |
| 9 | [Rary’s Telepathic Bond](/spells/2618925-rarys-telepathic-bond), [Telekinesis](/spells/2619157-telekinesis) |

##### Level 3: Telepathic Speech

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

##### Level 6: Psionic Sorcery

When you cast any level 1+ spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic components, and it requires no Material components unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.

##### Level 6: Psychic Defenses

You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws to avoid or end the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition.

##### Level 14: Revelation in Flesh

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You gain a Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.

***Glistening Flight.*** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.

***See the Invisible.*** You can see any [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover). Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.

***Wormlike Movement.*** Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition.

##### Level 18: Warping Implosion

You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Clockwork Sorcery

*Channel Cosmic Forces of Order*

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious system.

##### Level 3: Clockwork Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Clockwork Spells


| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Aid](/spells/2618845-aid), [Alarm](/spells/2619222-alarm), [Lesser Restoration](/spells/2619016-lesser-restoration), [Protection from Evil and Good](/spells/2618912-protection-from-evil-and-good) |
| 5 | [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic), [Protection from Energy](/spells/2618908-protection-from-energy) |
| 7 | [Freedom of Movement](/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement), [Summon Construct](/spells/2619111-summon-construct) |
| 9 | [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration), [Wall of Force](/spells/2619194-wall-of-force) |

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your Sorcerer spells.

##### Manifestations of Order


| 1d6 | Manifestation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Spectral cogwheels hover behind you. |
| 2 | The hands of a clock spin in your eyes. |
| 3 | Your skin glows with a brassy sheen. |
| 4 | Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body. |
| 5 | Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism. |
| 6 | The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

##### Level 3: Restore Balance

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) or [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage), you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 6: Bastion of Law

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) or until you use this feature again.

##### Level 14: Trance of Order

You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage), and whenever you make a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade

You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

***Heal.*** The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.

***Repair.*** Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.

***Dispel.*** Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

#### Draconic Sorcery

*Breathe the Magic of Dragons*

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

##### Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

##### Level 3: Draconic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Draconic Spells


| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Alter Self](/spells/2618846-alter-self), [Chromatic Orb](/spells/2618966-chromatic-orb), [Command](/spells/2618985-command), [Dragon’s Breath](/spells/2619150-dragons-breath) |
| 5 | [Fear](/spells/2618872-fear), [Fly](/spells/2618909-fly) |
| 7 | [Arcane Eye](/spells/2618863-arcane-eye), [Charm Monster](/spells/2618963-charm-monster) |
| 9 | [Legend Lore](/spells/2619010-legend-lore), [Summon Dragon](/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) |

##### Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.


##### Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast [Summon Dragon](/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

#### Wild Magic Sorcery

*Unleash Chaotic Magic*

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

##### Level 3: Wild Magic Surge

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge) to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

##### Level 3: Tides of Chaos

You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) before you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can use this feature again.

If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you automatically roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge).

##### Level 6: Bend Luck

You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.

##### Level 14: Controlled Chaos

You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge), you can roll twice and use either number.


##### Level 18: Tamed Surge

Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


##### Wild Magic Surge


| 1d100 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 01–04 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. |
| 05–08 | A creature that is [Friendly](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) toward you appears in a random unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The creature is under the DM’s control and disappears 1 minute later. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a **1**, a [Modron Duodrone](/monsters/17180-duodrone) appears; on a **2**, a [Flumph](/monsters/17145-flumph) appears; on a **3**, a [Modron Monodrone](/monsters/17176-monodrone) appears; on a **4**, a [Unicorn](/monsters/17042-unicorn) appears. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature’s stat block. |

| 61–64 | For the next minute, any flammable, nonmagical object you touch that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame, takes 1d4 Fire damage, and is burning. |
| 65–68 | If you die within the next hour, you immediately revive as if by the [Reincarnate](/spells/2618941-reincarnate) spell. |

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

#### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as [Pact of the Tome](#PactoftheTome). Invocations are described in the “[Eldritch Invocation Options](#EldritchInvocationOptions)” section later in this class’s description.

***Prerequisites.*** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

***Replacing and Gaining Invocations.*** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures).

You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the [Warlock spell list](#WarlockSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. [Eldritch Blast](/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) and [Prestidigitation](/spells/2618893-prestidigitation) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures).

***Spell Slots.*** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell [Witch Bolt](/spells/2619215-witch-bolt), you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The [Archfey Patron](#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the [Contact Other Plane](/spells/2619052-contact-other-plane) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures), you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Eldritch Master

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

### Eldritch Invocation Options

Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order.

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage*

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 Force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition if it is Huge or smaller.

#### Eldritch Spear

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage*

Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and has a range of 10+ feet. When you cast that spell, its range increases by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Warlock level.

#### Fiendish Vigor

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast [False Life](/spells/2618866-false-life) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints); you automatically get the highest number on the die.

#### Gaze of Two Minds

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way.

While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature’s space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.

#### Gift of the Depths

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

#### Gift of the Protectors

*Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, [Pact of the Tome](#PactoftheTome) Invocation*

A new page appears in your *Book of Shadows* when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it.

#### Investment of the Chain Master

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, [Pact of the Chain](#PactoftheChain) Invocation*

When you cast [Find Familiar](/spells/2618877-find-familiar), you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

***Quick Attack.*** As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action.

***Necrotic or Radiant Damage.*** Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

***Resistance.*** When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.

#### Lessons of the First Ones

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#OriginFeats)).

#### Mask of Many Faces

You can cast [Disguise Self](/spells/2619102-disguise-self) without expending a spell slot.

#### Otherworldly Leap

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast [Jump](/spells/2618991-jump) on yourself without expending a spell slot.

#### Pact of the Blade

As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

#### Pact of the Chain

You learn the [Find Familiar](/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](/monsters/4775825-imp), [Pseudodragon](/monsters/4775834-pseudodragon), [Quasit](/monsters/4775835-quasit), [Skeleton](/monsters/4775841-skeleton), [Slaad Tadpole](/monsters/4775842-slaad-tadpole), [Sphinx of Wonder](/monsters/4775843-sphinx-of-wonder), [Sprite](/monsters/4775845-sprite), or [Venomous Snake](/monsters/4775847-venomous-snake) (see [appendix B](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks/) for the familiar’s stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

#### Pact of the Tome

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). This *Book of Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

***Cantrips and Rituals.*** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

#### Repelling Blast

You can cast [Arcane Eye](/spells/2618863-arcane-eye) without expending a spell slot.

### Warlock Subclasses

A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Archfey Patron](#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses.

#### Archfey Patron

*Bargain with Whimsical Fey*

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.


##### Level 3: Archfey Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Archfey Spells


| Warlock Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Calm Emotions](/spells/2618959-calm-emotions), [Faerie Fire](/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step), [Phantasmal Force](/spells/2618854-phantasmal-force), [Sleep](/spells/2619064-sleep) |
| 5 | [Blink](/spells/2618939-blink), [Plant Growth](/spells/2618869-plant-growth) |
| 7 | [Dominate Beast](/spells/2619146-dominate-beast), [Greater Invisibility](/spells/2618958-greater-invisibility) |
| 9 | [Dominate Person](/spells/2619148-dominate-person), [Seeming](/spells/2619014-seeming) |

##### Level 3: Steps of the Fey

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

***Refreshing Step.*** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints).

***Taunting Step.*** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.


##### Level 6: Misty Escape

You can cast [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step) as a Reaction in response to taking damage.

In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.

***Disappearing Step.*** You have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

***Dreadful Step.*** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

##### Level 10: Beguiling Defenses

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 14: Bewitching Magic

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step) as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.

#### Celestial Patron

*Call on the Power of the Heavens*

Your pact draws on the Upper Planes, the realms of everlasting bliss. You might enter an agreement with an empyrean, a couatl, a sphinx, a unicorn, or another heavenly entity. Or you might call on numerous such beings as you pursue goals aligned with theirs. Your pact allows you to experience a hint of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.

##### Level 3: Celestial Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Celestial Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Celestial Spells


| Warlock Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Aid](/spells/2618845-aid), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), [Lesser Restoration](/spells/2619016-lesser-restoration), [Light](/spells/2618996-light), [Sacred Flame](/spells/2618967-sacred-flame) |
| 5 | [Daylight](/spells/2619083-daylight), [Revivify](/spells/2618956-revivify) |

| 9 | [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration), [Summon Celestial](/spells/2619108-summon-celestial) |

##### Level 3: Healing Light

You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 plus your Warlock level.

As a Bonus Action, you can heal yourself or one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, expending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can expend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you expend, and restore a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


##### Level 6: Radiant Soul

Your link to your patron allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have Resistance to Radiant damage. Once per turn, when a spell you cast deals Radiant or Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage against one of the spell’s targets.

##### Level 10: Celestial Resilience

You gain [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) whenever you use your Magical Cunning feature or finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). These Temporary Hit Points equal your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see when you gain the points. Those creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

##### Level 14: Searing Vengeance

When you or an ally within 60 feet of you is about to make a [Death Saving Throw](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeathSavingThrow), you can unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature regains Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum and can end the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition on itself. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of the creature takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Fiend Patron

*Make a Deal with the Lower Planes*

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.


##### Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit Points.

##### Level 3: Fiend Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


##### Fiend Spells


| Warlock Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | [Burning Hands](/spells/2618946-burning-hands), [Command](/spells/2618985-command), [Scorching Ray](/spells/2619005-scorching-ray), [Suggestion](/spells/2619101-suggestion) |
| 5 | [Fireball](/spells/2618887-fireball), [Stinking Cloud](/spells/2619091-stinking-cloud) |
| 7 | [Fire Shield](/spells/2618894-fire-shield), [Wall of Fire](/spells/2619107-wall-of-fire) |
| 9 | [Geas](/spells/2618940-geas), [Insect Plague](/spells/2619183-insect-plague) |

##### Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).


##### Level 10: Fiendish Resilience

Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

##### Level 14: Hurl Through Hell

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Great Old One Patron

*Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings*

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.

##### Level 3: Awakened Mind

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.

##### Level 3: Great Old One Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Great Old One Spells


| Warlock Level | Spells |

| 3 | [Detect Thoughts](/spells/2619099-detect-thoughts), [Dissonant Whispers](/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), [Phantasmal Force](/spells/2618854-phantasmal-force), [Tasha’s Hideous Laughter](/spells/2619132-tashas-hideous-laughter) |
| 5 | [Clairvoyance](/spells/2618972-clairvoyance), [Hunger of Hadar](/spells/2619162-hunger-of-hadar) |
| 7 | [Confusion](/spells/2619043-confusion), [Summon Aberration](/spells/2619105-summon-aberration) |
| 9 | [Modify Memory](/spells/2619109-modify-memory), [Telekinesis](/spells/2619157-telekinesis) |

##### Level 3: Psychic Spells

When you cast a Warlock spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Psychic. In addition, when you cast a Warlock spell that is an Enchantment or Illusion, you can do so without Verbal or Somatic components.

##### Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant

When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against you, and you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 10: Eldritch Hex

Your alien patron grants you a powerful curse. You always have the [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex) spell prepared. When you cast *Hex* and choose an ability, the target also has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws of the chosen ability for the duration of the spell.

##### Level 10: Thought Shield

Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have Resistance to Psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals Psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you take.

##### Level 14: Create Thrall

When you cast [Summon Aberration](/spells/2619105-summon-aberration), you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex), the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.

***Cantrips.*** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. [Light](/spells/2618996-light), [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand), and [Ray of Frost](/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures).

***Spellbook.*** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting [Identify](/spells/2619180-identify). You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Feather Fall](/spells/2618874-feather-fall), [Mage Armor](/spells/2619006-mage-armor), [Magic Missile](/spells/2619022-magic-missile), [Sleep](/spells/2619064-sleep), and [Thunderwave](/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures). The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

***Spell Slots.*** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) or your [spellbook](/equipment/86-spellbook) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

> ### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook
> 
> The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a [Spell Scroll](/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.
> 
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.
> 
> ***Copying the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

#### Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

#### Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: [Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [History](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Medicine](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Religion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). You have [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in the chosen skill.

#### Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The [Abjurer](#Abjurer), [Diviner](#Diviner), [Evoker](#Evoker), and [Illusionist](#Illusionist) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Memorize Spell

Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

#### Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

### Wizard Spell List

This section presents the Wizard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Wizard Subclasses

A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Abjurer](#Abjurer), [Diviner](#Diviner), [Evoker](#Evoker), and [Illusionist](#Illusionist) subclasses.

#### Abjurer

*Shield Companions and Banish Foes*

Your study of magic is focused on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide against a variety of hostile magic and other attacks.

##### Level 3: Abjuration Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Level 3: Arcane Ward

You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). The ward has a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 Hit Points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains.

Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alternatively, as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 6: Projected Ward

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage, you can take a Reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. If that creature has any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.

##### Level 10: Spell Breaker

You always have the [Counterspell](/spells/2619072-counterspell) and [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spells prepared. In addition, you can cast *Dispel Magic* as a Bonus Action, and you can add your Proficiency Bonus to its ability check.

When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.

##### Level 14: Spell Resistance

You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of spells.

#### Diviner

*Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse*

The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

##### Level 3: Divination Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Level 3: Portent

Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

##### Level 6: Expert Divination

Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2+ spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can’t be higher than level 5.

##### Level 10: The Third Eye

You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

***Darkvision.*** You gain [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 120 feet.

***Greater Comprehension.*** You can read any language.

***See Invisibility.*** You can cast [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility) without expending a spell slot.

##### Level 14: Greater Portent

The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature rather than two.

#### Evoker

*Create Explosive Elemental Effects*

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.

##### Level 3: Evocation Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

##### Level 6: Sculpt Spells

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

#### Illusionist

*Weave Subtle Spells of Deception*

You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.

##### Level 3: Illusion Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Level 3: Improved Illusions

You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components, and if an Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.

You also know the [Minor Illusion](/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of *Minor Illusion*, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.

##### Level 6: Phantasmal Creatures

You always have the [Summon Beast](/spells/2619106-summon-beast) and [Summon Fey](/spells/2619115-summon-fey) spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to Illusion, which causes the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast the spell in that way again.

##### Level 10: Illusory Self

When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).

##### Level 14: Illusory Reality

You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can’t deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.
