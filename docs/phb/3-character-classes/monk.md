Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

### Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons, which are the following:

* Simple Melee weapons
* Martial Melee weapons that have the [Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light) property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

***Bonus Unarmed Strike.*** You can make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

***Martial Arts Die.*** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

***Dexterous Attacks.*** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

### Level 2: Monk's Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Monk Features table](#MonkFeatures).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

***Flurry of Blows.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

***Patient Defense.*** You can take the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) actions as a Bonus Action.

***Step of the Wind.*** You can take the [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Level 2: Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the [Monk Features table](#MonkFeatures).

### Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack's total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack's force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

### Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The [Warrior of Mercy](#WarriorofMercy), [Warrior of Shadow](#WarriorofShadow), [Warrior of the Elements](#WarrioroftheElements), and [Warrior of the Open Hand](#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Monk level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 4: Slow Fall

You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

### Level 5: Stunning Strike

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target's Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

### Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

### Level 7: Evasion

When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.

You don't benefit from this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

### Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

### Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.

***Flurry of Blows.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with it instead of two.

***Patient Defense.*** When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

***Step of the Wind.*** When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature's movement doesn't provoke [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

### Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition).

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn't give you levels of [Exhaustion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

### Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

### Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

### Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and don't use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

### Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

### Level 20: Body and Mind

You have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

## Monk Subclasses

A Monk subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Warrior of Mercy](#WarriorofMercy), [Warrior of Shadow](#WarriorofShadow), [Warrior of the Elements](#WarrioroftheElements), and [Warrior of the Open Hand](#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclasses.

### Warrior of Mercy

*Manipulate Forces of Life and Death*

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death.

#### Level 3: Hand of Harm

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

#### Level 3: Hand of Healing

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of Hit Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.

#### Level 3: Implements of Mercy

You gain proficiency in the [Insight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Medicine](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skills and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.

#### Level 6: Physician's Touch

Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.

***Hand of Harm.*** When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

***Hand of Healing.*** When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), or [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition).

#### Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm

When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an Unarmed Strike with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), and [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Warrior of Shadow

*Harness Shadow Power for Stealth and Subterfuge*

Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and subterfuge, harnessing the power of the Shadowfell. They are at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around themselves to hide, leap from shadow to shadow, and take on a wraithlike form.

#### Level 3: Shadow Arts

You have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits.

***Darkness.*** You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the [Darkness](/spells/2619080-darkness) spell without spell components. You can see within the spell's area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can move its area of [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) to a space within 60 feet of yourself at the start of each of your turns.

You then have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the next melee attack you make before the end of the current turn.

#### Level 11: Improved Shadow Step

You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When you use your Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement that you must start and end in [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) for that use of the feature. As part of this Bonus Action, you can make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) immediately after you teleport.

#### Level 17: Cloak of Shadows

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action while entirely within [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness), you can expend 3 Focus Points to shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or until you end your turn in [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight). While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following benefits.

***Invisibility.*** You have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition.

***Partially Incorporeal.*** You can move through occupied spaces as if they were [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain). If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you were in.

***Shadow Flurry.*** You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus Points.

### Warrior of the Elements

*Wield Strikes and Bursts of Elemental Power*

#### Level 3: Elemental Attunement

At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.

***Reach.*** When you make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

***Elemental Strikes.*** Whenever you hit with your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.

#### Level 3: Manipulate Elements

You know the [Elementalism](/spells/2618834-elementalism) spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

#### Level 6: Elemental Burst

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 2 Focus Points to cause elemental energy to burst in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on a point within 120 feet of yourself. Choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

Each creature in the Sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

#### Level 11: Stride of the Elements

While your Elemental Attunement is active, you also have a Fly Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

#### Level 17: Elemental Epitome

While your Elemental Attunement is active, you also gain the following benefits.

***Damage Resistance.*** You gain Resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. At the start of each of your turns, you can change this choice.

***Destructive Stride.*** When you use your Step of the Wind, your Speed increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn. For that duration, any creature of your choice takes damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you enter a space within 5 feet of it. The damage type is your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Empowered Strikes.*** Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). The extra damage is the same type dealt by that strike.

### Warrior of the Open Hand

*Master Unarmed Combat Techniques*

Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.

#### Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

***Addle.*** The target can't make [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of its next turn.

***Push.*** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

***Topple.*** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

#### Level 6: Wholeness of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.

#### Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).
