Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](#RangerSpellList) later in the class’s description.

***Spell Slots.*** The [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+***. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a [Druidic Focus](/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures).

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

### Level 2: Deft Explorer

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

***Expertise.*** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in that skill.

***Languages.*** You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in [chapter 2](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character#ChooseLanguages).

### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats)). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

***Druidic Warrior.*** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a [list of Druid spells](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList)). [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Starry Wisp](/spells/2618840-starry-wisp) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

### Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice.The [Beast Master](#BeastMaster), [Fey Wanderer](#FeyWanderer), [Gloom Stalker](#GloomStalker), and [Hunter](#Hunter) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

### Level 6: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

### Level 9: Expertise

Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in those skills.

### Level 10: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

***Temporary Hit Points.*** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can give yourself a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Decrease Exhaustion.*** Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), your [Exhaustion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level, if any, decreases by 1.

### Level 13: Relentless Hunter

Taking damage can’t break your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark).

### Level 14: Nature’s Veil

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

### Level 20: Foe Slayer

The damage die of your [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) is a d10 rather than a d6.

## Ranger Subclasses

A Ranger subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Beast Master](#BeastMaster), [Fey Wanderer](#FeyWanderer), [Gloom Stalker](#GloomStalker), and [Hunter](#Hunter) subclasses.

### Beast Master

*Bond with a Primal Beast*

A Beast Master forms a mystical bond with a special animal, drawing on primal magic and a deep connection to the natural world.

#### Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: **[Beast of the Land](#BeastoftheLand)**, **[Beast of the Sea](#BeastoftheSea)**, or **[Beast of the Sky](#BeastoftheSky)**. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is [Friendly](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.

***The Beast in Combat.*** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.

***Restoring or Replacing the Beast.*** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

In addition, whenever it hits with an attack roll and deals damage, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### Level 11: Bestial Fury

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of your [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

#### Level 15: Share Spells

When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Primal Companion beast with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

### Fey Wanderer

*Wield Fey Mirth and Fury*

A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey or a location in the Feywild that transformed you. However you gained fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer. Your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.
