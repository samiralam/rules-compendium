# Chapter 5: Feats

This chapter offers a collection of feats, which are special features not tied to a character class. A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

The sections below explain the parts of a feat and list a variety of feat options separated into categories.

Your background gives you a feat, and at certain levels, your class gives you the [Ability Score Improvement](#AbilityScoreImprovement) feat or the choice of another feat for which you qualify.

By whatever means you acquire a feat, you can take it only once unless its description says otherwise.

Feat Descriptions
-----------------

This chapter’s feats are organized by category—[Origin](#OriginFeats), [General](#GeneralFeats), [Fighting Style](#FightingStyleFeats), or [Epic Boon](#EpicBoonFeats)—and alphabetized in each category. All the feats are listed alphabetically in the [Feat List table](#FeatList). If a feat can be taken more than once, an asterisk appears after its name in that table.

### Parts of a Feat

The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat’s name.

***Category.*** A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you’re instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat’s name. If you’re instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category.

***Prerequisite.*** To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat.

***Benefit.*** The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits.

***Repeatable.*** A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a “Repeatable” subsection.
