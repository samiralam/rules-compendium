*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect). Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

---

## [Aid](/spells/2618845-aid)

*Level 2 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)

**Duration:** 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Each target's Hit Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Alarm](/spells/2619222-alarm)

*Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect). Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

**Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.

**Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

---

## [Alter Self](/spells/2618846-alter-self)

*Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

- ***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
- ***Change Appearance.*** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to change your appearance in this way again.
- ***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

---

## [Animal Friendship](/spells/2618847-animal-friendship)

*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)

**Duration:** 24 hours

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Animal Messenger](/spells/2618850-animal-messenger)

*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)

**Duration:** 24 hours

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target's Challenge Rating isn't 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.

When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell's duration increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Animal Shapes](/spells/2618851-animal-shapes)

*Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target [shape-shifts](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to transform the targets again.

A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in that form.

The target gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the Beast form's Hit Points. The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, until the target has no Temporary Hit Points, or until the target leaves the form as a Bonus Action.

---

## [Animate Dead](/spells/2618853-animate-dead)

*Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a [Skeleton](/monsters/4775841-skeleton) if you chose bones or a [Zombie](/monsters/4775851-zombie) if you chose a corpse (see [appendix B](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks/) for the stat blocks).

On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

---

## [Animate Objects](/spells/2618855-animate-objects)

*Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.

Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the **Animated Object** stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller), 1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.

## [Antilife Shell](/spells/2618856-antilife-shell)

*Level 5 Abjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

An aura extends from you in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

---

## [Antimagic Field](/spells/2618860-antimagic-field)

*Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (iron filings)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect). No one can cast spells, take [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) actions, or create other magical effects inside the aura, and those things can't target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items don't work inside the aura or on anything inside it.

Areas of effect created by spells or other magic can't extend into the aura, and no one can teleport into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals close temporarily while in the aura.

Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

[Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different *Antimagic Field* spells don't nullify each other.

---

## [Antipathy/Sympathy](/spells/2618862-antipathy-sympathy)

*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)

**Duration:** 10 days

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

**Antipathy.** The creature has the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.

**Sympathy.** The creature has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

---

## [Arcane Eye](/spells/2618863-arcane-eye)

*Level 4 Divination (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You create an [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition), invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 30 feet.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

---

## [Arcane Gate](/spells/2618865-arcane-gate)

*Level 6 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 500 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You create linked teleportation portals. Choose two Large, unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one space within range and the other one within 10 feet of you. A circular portal opens in each of those spaces and remains for the duration.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist that blocks sight. They hover inches from the ground and are perpendicular to it.

A portal is open on only one side (you choose which). Anything entering the open side of a portal exits from the open side of the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other. As a Bonus Action, you can change the facing of the open sides.

---

## [Arcane Lock](/spells/2618868-arcane-lock)

*Level 2 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.

---

## [Arcane Vigor](/spells/2618831-arcane-vigor)

*Level 2 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Component:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended Hit Point Dice, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Armor of Agathys](/spells/2618870-armor-of-agathys)

*Level 1 Abjuration (Warlock)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of blue glass)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Protective magical frost surrounds you. You gain 5 [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints). If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll before the spell ends, the creature takes 5 Cold damage. The spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Temporary Hit Points and the Cold damage both increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Arms of Hadar](/spells/2618871-arms-of-hadar)

*Level 1 Conjuration (Warlock)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Astral Projection](/spells/2618878-astral-projection)

*Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (for each of the spell's targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.

A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.

A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.

Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to dismiss it.

When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

---

## [Augury](/spells/2618882-augury)

*Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, cards, or other divinatory tokens worth 25+ GP)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.


### Omens


| Omen | For Results That Will Be... |
| --- | --- |
| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad |

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

---

## [Aura of Life](/spells/2618884-aura-of-life)

*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.

---

## [Aura of Purity](/spells/2618888-aura-of-purity)

*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Druid, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [Awakened Shrub](/monsters/16791-awakened-shrub) or [Awakened Tree](/monsters/16792-awakened-tree) in the *Monster Manual*.

The awakened target has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.

**Range:** Self

**Component:** V

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

The target hit by the attack roll takes an extra 5d10 Force damage from the attack. If the attack reduces the target to 50 Hit Points or fewer, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

**Casting Time:** Action

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

---

## [Barkskin](/spells/2618907-barkskin)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other knowledgeable entity from another plane. Contacting this otherworldly intelligence can break your mind.

The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question).

Your touch inflicts a magical contagion. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 11d8 Necrotic damage and have the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. While Poisoned, the target has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws made with the chosen ability.

The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until it gets three successes or failures. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends on the target. If the target fails three of the saves, the spell lasts for 7 days on it.

Whenever the Poisoned target receives an effect that would end the Poisoned condition, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the Poisoned condition doesn't end on it.

---

## [Contingency](/spells/2619053-contingency)

*Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP)

**Duration:** 10 days

Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting *Contingency*, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a *Contingency* cast with [Water Breathing](/spells/2619205-water-breathing) might stipulate that *Water Breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then *Contingency* ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one *Contingency* spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another *Contingency* spell on you ends. Also, *Contingency* ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

## [Continual Flame](/spells/2619065-continual-flame)

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

---

## [Control Water](/spells/2619070-control-water)

*Level 4 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

***Part Water.*** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch up to four nonmagical [Arrows](/equipment/508-arrows) or [Bolts](/equipment/510-bolts) and plant them in the ground in your space. Until the spell ends, the ammunition can't be physically uprooted, and whenever a creature other than you enters a space within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 Piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when none of the ammunition remains planted in the ground.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each spell slot level above 2.

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

The food is bland but nourishing and looks like a food of your choice, and the water is clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Each one becomes a [Ghoul](/monsters/16872-ghoul) under your control (see the *Monster Manual* for its stat block).

As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating new ones.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** If you use a level 7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four [Ghouls](/monsters/16872-ghoul). If you use a level 8 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five [Ghouls](/monsters/16872-ghoul) or two [Ghasts](/monsters/16870-ghast) or [Wights](/monsters/17059-wight).

**Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object within range.

The object must be no larger than a 5-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect), and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen.

The spell's duration depends on the object's material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to fail.


### Materials

The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if no creature is within its reach. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

On your later turns, you must take the [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to maintain control of the target, or the spell ends.

[Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) or [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 Hit Points before the spell ends, the target instead drops to 1 Hit Point, and the spell ends.

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended.

If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard).

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.

When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be shunted through the door as it vanishes, landing with the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition in the unoccupied spaces closest to the door's former space.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that demiplane instead.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

***Read Thoughts.*** Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

You can also teleport one willing creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space.

If you, the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.

## [Disguise Self](/spells/2619102-disguise-self)

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC.

The target can be revived only by a [True Resurrection](/spells/2619199-true-resurrection) or a [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-[Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) portion of it.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane if it isn't there already. If they aren't on their home plane, Undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and Fey are sent to the Feywild.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

Regardless of its Hit Points, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend target that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to the current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) spell.

### Divine Word Effects

On a failed save, a creature has the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition, and its [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) is broken.

You can also cause the effects below.

***Fissures.*** A total of 1d6 fissures open in the spell's area at the end of the turn you cast it. You choose the fissures' locations, which can't be under structures. Each fissure is 1d10 × 10 feet deep and 10 feet wide, and it extends from one edge of the spell's area to another edge. A creature in the same space as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses.

A creature within a distance from a collapsing structure equal to half the structure's height makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action to escape. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

A flammable object hit by this spell starts [burning](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard) if it isn't being worn or carried.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.

Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d10 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 10 feet.

*Level 5 Evocation (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action

A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 Fire damage and 5d6 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.

---

*Level 2 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of wax)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard) if touched by the sphere, and it sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet.

## [Flesh to Stone](/spells/2618905-flesh-to-stone)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a cockatrice feather)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition for the duration. On a successful save, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn. Constructs automatically succeed on the save.

A Restrained target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and has the [Petrified](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition for the duration. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target is Petrified until the condition is ended by [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) or similar magic.

---

## [Fly](/spells/2618909-fly)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a feather)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target gains a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft unless it can stop the fall.

---

## [Fog Cloud](/spells/2618910-fog-cloud)

*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is [Heavily Obscured](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HeavilyObscured). It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [Gust of Wind](/spells/2619137-gust-of-wind)) disperses it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Forbiddance](/spells/2618913-forbiddance)

*Level 6 Abjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes or Ritual

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,000+ GP)

**Duration:** 1 day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the [Gate](/spells/2618932-gate) spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the [Plane Shift](/spells/2618867-plane-shift) spell.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature of a chosen type enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).

You can designate a password when you cast the spell. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another *Forbiddance* spell. If you cast *Forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are consumed on the last casting.

---

## [Forcecage](/spells/2618916-forcecage)

*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

An immobile, [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition), [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect)-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside it.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn't exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can't be dispelled by [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic).

---

## [Foresight](/spells/2618918-foresight)

The spell ends early if you cast it again.

---

## [Fount of Moonlight](/spells/2618835-fount-of-moonlight)

*Level 4 Evocation (Bard, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have Resistance to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

---

## [Freedom of Movement](/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement)

*Level 4 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's Speed nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) or [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition on it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

---

## [Friends](/spells/2618924-friends)

*Enchantment Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** S, M (some makeup)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if it isn't a Humanoid, if you're fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on it within the past 24 hours.

The spell ends early if the target takes damage or if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or force anyone to make a saving throw. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.



## [Gaseous Form](/spells/2618927-gaseous-form)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

A willing creature you touch [shape-shifts](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting), along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends on the target if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if it takes a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to end the spell on itself.

While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a Fly Speed of 10 feet, and it can hover. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has Immunity to the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition; and it has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.

The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast spells.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.

---

## [Gate](/spells/2618932-gate)

*Level 9 Conjuration (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the portal's destination is visible through it.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens next to the named creature and transports it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

---

## [Geas](/spells/2618940-geas)

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 30 days

You give a verbal command to a creature that you can see within range, ordering it to carry out some service or refrain from an action or a course of activity as you decide. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration. The target automatically succeeds if it can't understand your command.

While Charmed, the creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage if it acts in a manner directly counter to your command. It takes this damage no more than once each day.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

A [Remove Curse](/spells/2618943-remove-curse), [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration), or [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) spell ends this spell.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** If you use a level 7 or 8 spell slot, the duration is 365 days. If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

---

## [Gentle Repose](/spells/2618942-gentle-repose)

*Level 2 Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (2 Copper Pieces, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become Undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as [Raise Dead](/spells/2618922-raise-dead).

---

## [Giant Insect](/spells/2618944-giant-insect)

*Level 4 Conjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the **Giant Insect** stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.

---

## [Globe of Invulnerability](/spells/2618950-globe-of-invulnerability)

*Level 6 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a glass bead)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect anything within it. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from areas of effect created by such spells.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The barrier blocks spells of 1 level higher for each spell slot level above 6.

---

## [Glyph of Warding](/spells/2618951-glyph-of-warding)

*Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom ([Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC to notice.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.

***Set the Trigger.*** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

***Explosive Rune.*** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spell Glyph.*** You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.

When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons [Hostile](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude) creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), it lasts until the end of its full duration.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the *Glyph of Warding*.

**Duration:** 24 hours

Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a Bonus Action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 Hit Point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.

## [Grasping Vine](/spells/2618955-grasping-vine)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.

A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion.

- **Chaining.** Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold the target in place. The target has the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and can't be moved by any means.
- **Hedged Prison.** The target is trapped in a demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.
- **Minimus Containment.** The target becomes 1 inch tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.
- **Slumber.** The target has the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition and can't be awoken.

***Ending the Spell.*** When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific monster.

A [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create it.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If the target is held shut by [Arcane Lock](/spells/2618868-arcane-lock), that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.

Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing, as described by the DM.

The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more information you already know about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. That information is accurate but might be couched in figurative language or poetry, as determined by the DM.

If the famous thing you chose isn't actually famous, you hear sad musical notes played on a trombone, and the spell fails.

*Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serve as Material components for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic action to touch the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance at the end of each day that the spell ends. The spell also ends if you cast this spell again or if the Tiny replica chest is destroyed. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, the chest remains there for you or someone else to find.

**Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the Emanation isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.

Creatures and objects within the Emanation when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.

The atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) or [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) (no action required). The Emanation is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside.

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically up to 20 feet and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate an object that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes 4d8 Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (fur from a bloodhound)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a [Flesh to Stone](/spells/2618905-flesh-to-stone) or [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph) spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

## [Magic Circle](/spells/2619018-magic-circle)

*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall [Cylinder](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

* The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
* The creature has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.

---

## [Magic Jar](/spells/2619021-magic-jar)

*Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth 500+ GP)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid's body.

You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a [Protection from Evil and Good](/spells/2618912-protection-from-evil-and-good) or [Magic Circle](/spells/2619018-magic-circle) spell can't be [possessed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Possession)). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature's. You otherwise keep your game statistics.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

While possessing a body, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

## [Magic Missile](/spells/2619022-magic-missile)

*Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Magic Mouth](/spells/2619023-magic-mouth)

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

---

## [Magic Weapon](/spells/2619024-magic-weapon)

*Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3–5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

## [Major Image](/spells/2619025-major-image)

*Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect). The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.

If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

## [Mass Suggestion](/spells/2619029-mass-suggestion)

*Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, "Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset." Or you could say, "Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour."

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days).

---

## [Maze](/spells/2619030-maze)

*Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

---

## [Meld into Stone](/spells/2619031-meld-into-stone)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom ([Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage). You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

---

## [Melf's Acid Arrow](/spells/2619032-melfs-acid-arrow)

*Level 2 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Mending](/spells/2619033-mending)

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

---

## [Message](/spells/2619034-message)

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** S, M (a copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 round

You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

---

## [Meteor Swarm](/spells/2619035-meteor-swarm)

*Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts [burning](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard) if it's flammable.

---

## [Mind Blank](/spells/2619036-mind-blank)

*Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish)—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

---

## [Mind Sliver](/spells/2619037-mind-sliver)

*Enchantment Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 round

You try to temporarily sliver the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 Psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

---

## [Mind Spike](/spells/2619038-mind-spike)

*Level 2 Divination (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Minor Illusion](/spells/2619039-minor-illusion)

*Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.

If a creature takes a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

***Sound.*** If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

***Image.*** If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect). The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

---

## [Mirage Arcane](/spells/2619040-mirage-arcane)

*Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain) (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

Creatures with [Truesight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight) can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

---

## [Mirror Image](/spells/2619060-mirror-image)

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.

Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition, [Blindsight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Blindsight), or [Truesight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight).

---

## [Mislead](/spells/2619131-mislead)

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You gain the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.

---

## [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step)

*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

---

## [Modify Memory](/spells/2619109-modify-memory)

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the save. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.

A [Remove Curse](/spells/2618943-remove-curse) or [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

---

## [Moonbeam](/spells/2619134-moonbeam)

*Level 2 Evocation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) fills the Cylinder, and you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is [shape-shifted](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) (as a result of the [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph) spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

## [Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound](/spells/2619110-mordenkainens-faithful-hound)

*Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a silver whistle)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound remains for the duration or until the two of you are more than 300 feet apart from each other.

No one but you can see the hound, and it is intangible and invulnerable. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound has [Truesight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight) with a range of 30 feet.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one enemy within 5 feet of it. That enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 Force damage.

On your later turns, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to move the hound up to 30 feet.

---

## [Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion](/spells/2619112-mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion)

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts for the duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door remains open. You can open or close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.

Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling's atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like for the dwelling, but it can't exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot [Cubes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect). The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from it.

A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You determine the appearance of these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can perform tasks that a human could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can't leave the dwelling.

When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.

---

## [Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum](/spells/2619114-mordenkainens-private-sanctum)

*Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

* Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
* The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision)) through it.
* Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
* Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
* Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
* Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can increase the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell slot level above 4.

---

## [Mordenkainen's Sword](/spells/2619118-mordenkainens-sword)

*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

---

## [Move Earth](/spells/2619120-move-earth)

*Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature shovel)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.



## [Nondetection](/spells/2619122-nondetection)

*Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from Divination spells. The target can be a willing creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

---

## [Nystul's Magic Aura](/spells/2619124-nystuls-magic-aura)

*Level 2 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)

**Duration:** 24 hours

With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until dispelled.

***Mask (Creature).*** Choose a creature type other than the target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of the chosen type.

***False Aura (Object).*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras, such as [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic). You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic you choose.



## [Otiluke's Freezing Sphere](/spells/2619126-otilukes-freezing-sphere)

*Level 6 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect). Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell's casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

---

## [Otiluke's Resilient Sphere](/spells/2619128-otilukes-resilient-sphere)

*Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A [Disintegrate](/spells/2619094-disintegrate) spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

---

## [Otto's Irresistible Dance](/spells/2619130-ottos-irresistible-dance)

*Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for the duration. While Charmed, the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.



## [Passwall](/spells/2618852-passwall)

*Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)

**Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

## [Pass without Trace](/spells/2618849-pass-without-trace)

*Level 2 Abjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from burned mistletoe)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You radiate a concealing aura in a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) for the duration. While in the aura, you and each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([Stealth](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and leave no tracks.

---

## [Phantasmal Force](/spells/2618854-phantasmal-force)

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

The target can take a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.

An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

---

## [Phantasmal Killer](/spells/2618857-phantasmal-killer)

*Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

---

## [Phantom Steed](/spells/2618859-phantom-steed)

*Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the [Riding Horse](/monsters/4775839-riding-horse) stat block (see [appendix B](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks#RidingHorse)), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.

---

## [Planar Ally](/spells/2618861-planar-ally)

*Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

---

## [Planar Binding](/spells/2618864-planar-binding)

*Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted version of the [Magic Circle](/spells/2619018-magic-circle) spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is [Hostile](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude), it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

---

## [Plane Shift](/spells/2618867-plane-shift)

*Level 7 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth 250+ GP and attuned to a plane of existence)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the DM.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

---

## [Plant Growth](/spells/2618869-plant-growth)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action (Overgrowth) or 8 hours (Enrichment)

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.

***Overgrowth.*** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

***Enrichment.*** All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one *Plant Growth* per year.

---

## [Poison Spray](/spells/2618875-poison-spray)

*Necromancy Cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

---

## [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph)

*Level 4 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or [shape-shift](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice.

The target gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

**Component:** V

*Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Component:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its Hit Points. If the creature has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), or [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition, it can use its Reaction to stand up.

---

## [Power Word Kill](/spells/2618886-power-word-kill)

*Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Component:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You compel one creature you can see within range to die. If the target has 100 Hit Points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 12d12 Psychic damage.

---

*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) and also regain 2d8 Hit Points. A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

## [Prismatic Spray](/spells/2618895-prismatic-spray)

*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot [Cone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect). Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.


### Prismatic Rays


| 1d8 | Ray |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [Petrified](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition until it is freed by an effect like the [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). |
| 8 | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8. |

---

## [Prismatic Wall](/spells/2618898-prismatic-wall)

*Level 9 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect.

The wall sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) within 100 feet and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.

The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. [Antimagic Field](/spells/2618860-antimagic-field) has no effect on the wall, and [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) can affect only the violet layer.


#### Prismatic Layers


| Order | Effects |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Cold damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* Magical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](/spells/2619137-gust-of-wind)). |
| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 Force damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* A [Passwall](/spells/2618852-passwall) spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |
| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [Petrified](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition until it is freed by an effect like the [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. *Additional Effects:* Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) shed by the [Daylight](/spells/2619083-daylight) spell. |
| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). *Additional Effects:* This layer is destroyed by [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic). |

## [Produce Flame](/spells/2618901-produce-flame)

*Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

---

## [Programmed Illusion](/spells/2618902-programmed-illusion)

*Level 6 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect), and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

---

## [Project Image](/spells/2618903-project-image)

*Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 500 miles

**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself worth 5+ GP)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can see through the illusion's eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can move it up to 60 feet and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [possessed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Possession) by or gain the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

---

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 500+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no longer than 10 days and it wasn't Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to [D20 Tests](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test). Every time the target finishes a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all [curses](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses) affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall.

At the rope's upper end, an [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) 3-foot-by-5-foot portal opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. That space can be reached by climbing the rope, which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth 1,000+ GP, such as a crystal ball, mirror, or water-filled font)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified (see the tables below) by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. The target doesn't know what it is making the save against, only that it feels uneasy.

| Your Knowledge of the Target Is... | Save Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Secondhand (heard of the target) | +5 |
| Firsthand (met the target) | +0 |
| Extensive (know the target well) | −5 |

| You Have the Target's... | Save Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Picture or other likeness | −2 |
| Garment or other possession | −4 |
| Body part, lock of hair, or bit of nail | −10 |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell on it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition), intangible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. If something can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a location you have seen. When you do so, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

---

## [Searing Smite](/spells/2619009-searing-smite)

*Level 1 Evocation (Paladin)*

**Component:** V

**Duration:** 1 minute

As you hit the target, it takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage from the attack. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target takes 1d6 Fire damage and then makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell continues. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** All the damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility)

**Duration:** 1 hour

## [Seeming](/spells/2619014-seeming)

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.

A creature that takes the [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine a target can make an Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

---

## [Sending](/spells/2619015-sending)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to a creature you have met or a creature described to you by someone who has met it. The target hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables targets to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. You know if the delivery fails.

Upon receiving your message, a creature can block your ability to reach it again with this spell for 8 hours. If you try to send another message during that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the spell fails.

If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you shape-shift, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the Hit Points of the form. The spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points left.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

A Construct has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.

## [Shocking Grasp](/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp)

*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect). The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC.

---

## [Simulacrum](/spells/2618995-simulacrum)

**Casting Time:** 12 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum is half as much, and it can't cast this spell.

The simulacrum is [Friendly](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short or [Long Rests](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a Long Rest, during which you expend components worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.

The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.

The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain) caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.

The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.

If a Plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language.

When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural.

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

## [Symbol](/spells/2619127-symbol)

*Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom ([Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC to notice.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.

***Set the Trigger.*** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.

You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) with [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.

***Death.*** Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

***Discord.*** Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Fear.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

***Pain.*** Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition for 1 minute.

***Sleep.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake.

***Stunning.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition for 1 minute.

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause psychic energy to erupt at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d6 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts 1d6 from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any Constitution saving throws to maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



## [Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron](/spells/2618841-tashas-bubbling-cauldron)

*Level 6 Conjuration (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 5 feet

**Component:** V, S, M (a gilded ladle worth 500+ GP)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You conjure a claw-footed cauldron filled with bubbling liquid. The cauldron appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you and lasts for the duration. The cauldron can't be moved and disappears when the spell ends, along with the bubbling liquid inside it.

The liquid in the cauldron duplicates the properties of a Common or an Uncommon potion of your choice (such as a [Potion of Healing](/magic-items/8960641-potion-of-healing)). As a Bonus Action, you or an ally can reach into the cauldron and withdraw one potion of that kind. The potion is contained in a vial that disappears when the potion is consumed. The cauldron can produce a number of these potions equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). When the last of these potions is withdrawn from the cauldron, the cauldron disappears, and the spell ends.

Potions obtained from the cauldron that aren't consumed disappear when you cast this spell again.

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) and [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable of laughter, and it can't end the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition on itself.

At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

## [Telekinesis](/spells/2619157-telekinesis)

*Level 5 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action on your later turns before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

***Creature.*** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save.

***Object.*** You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

## [Telepathy](/spells/2619159-telepathy)

*Level 8 Divination (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Unlimited

**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of linked silver rings)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantly share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with each other through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature to understand the meaning of your words and any sensory messages you send to it.

---

## [Teleport](/spells/2619163-teleport)

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.


### Teleportation Outcome


| Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Permanent circle | — | — | — | 01–00 |
| Linked object | — | — | — | 01–00 |
| Very familiar | 01–05 | 06–13 | 14–24 | 25–00 |
| Seen casually | 01–33 | 34–43 | 44–53 | 54–00 |
| Viewed once or described | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–00 |
| False destination | 01–50 | 51–00 | — | — |

***Familiarity.*** Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:

* "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
* "Linked object" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.
* "Very familiar" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
* "Seen casually" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.
* "Viewed once or described" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
* "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.

***Mishap.*** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.

***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: **1**, east; **2**, southeast; **3**, south; **4**, southwest; **5**, west; **6**, northwest; **7**, north; or **8**, northeast.

***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.

## [Teleportation Circle](/spells/2619167-teleportation-circle)

*Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, M (rare inks worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.

When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.

## [Tenser's Floating Disk](/spells/2619169-tensers-floating-disk)

*Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

The creature [shape-shifts](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into a different creature or a nonmagical object, or the object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried). The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration on this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until dispelled.

An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

***Creature into Creature.*** If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's Challenge Rating or level. The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and personality.

The target gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the Hit Points of the new form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

Guided by a flash of magical insight, you make one attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting.

A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 Bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave's force, though, the creature must succeed on a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the wall falls to the ground.

The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall.

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic). A [Disintegrate](/spells/2619094-disintegrate) spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per 10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

## [Wall of Stone](/spells/2619200-wall-of-stone)

*Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a cube of granite)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

If you maintain your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on this spell for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

## [Wall of Thorns](/spells/2619202-wall-of-thorns)

*Level 6 Conjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 6.

## [Warding Bond](/spells/2619203-warding-bond)

*Level 2 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth 50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.

---


## [Water Breathing](/spells/2619205-water-breathing)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a short reed)

**Duration:** 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

---

## [Water Walk](/spells/2619207-water-walk)

*Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range gain this ability for the duration.

An affected target must take a Bonus Action to pass from the liquid's surface into the liquid itself and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid, the target passes through the surface into the liquid below.

---

## [Web](/spells/2619208-web)

*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) there for the duration. The webs are [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain), and the area within them is [Lightly Obscured](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured).

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

---

## [Weird](/spells/2619210-weird)

*Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.

---

## [Wind Walk](/spells/2619211-wind-walk)

*Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a candle)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action or a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action followed by a 1-minute transformation.

If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.

---

## [Wind Wall](/spells/2619212-wind-wall)

*Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a fan and a feather)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

---

## [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish)

*Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

- **Object Creation.** You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.
- **Instant Health.** You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the [Greater Restoration](/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell.
- **Resistance.** You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.
- **Spell Immunity.** You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
- **Sudden Learning.** You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.
- **Roll Redo.** You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *Wish* spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) or [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage), and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
- **Reshape Reality.** You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.

The stress of casting *Wish* to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *Wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.

## [Witch Bolt](/spells/2619215-witch-bolt)

*Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 Lightning damage.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a Bonus Action to deal 1d12 Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) from you.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The initial damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 1.

---

## [Word of Radiance](/spells/2619217-word-of-radiance)

*Evocation Cantrip (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, M (a sunburst token)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Burning radiance erupts from you in a 5-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect). Each creature of your choice that you can see in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Radiant damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

---

## [Word of Recall](/spells/2619218-word-of-recall)

*Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 5 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.

You must designate a location, such as a temple, as a sanctuary by casting this spell there.

---

## [Wrathful Smite](/spells/2619220-wrathful-smite)

*Level 1 Necromancy (Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike

**Range:** Self

**Component:** V

**Duration:** 1 minute

The target takes an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage from the attack, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the Frightened target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.



## [Yolande's Regal Presence](/spells/2618842-yolandes-regal-presence)

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Component:** V, S, M (a miniature tiara)

**Duration:** [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect). Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes 4d6 Psychic damage and has the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target
takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.


## [Zone of Truth](/spells/2619221-zone-of-truth)

*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.
