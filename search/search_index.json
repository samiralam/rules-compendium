It's helpful to have an agreed-on signal that players can use to communicate that a limit has been violated, allowing you to adjust quickly. That signal might be a gesture (such as crossing the arms in an X or raising a palm in a \"stop\" gesture), a code word or phrase, touching or lifting a designated object, or anything else your group agrees on. Players should also feel safe to say \"stop\" and pause the game until the issue is resolved. The person who invokes the signals can comment on what they want adjusted but doesn't have to explain why the content is objectionable. The signal shouldn't trigger a debate or discussion: thank the player for being honest about their needs, set the scene right, and move on.</p> <p>Make it clear to players that if a person isn't comfortable using the signal, they can step away from the game or call for a break to talk to you privately.

Having no fixed appearance or gender, they can assume whatever forms they like. Occasionally these deities manifest and perform mythic deeds among mortals.</p> <p>Lesser deities are typically described in myth as the creations, children, or servitors of the greater deities. They govern narrower provinces, such as the activities of mortal life or limited aspects of the natural world. They share the fundamentally ineffable nature of greater gods, but they are more likely to manifest in mortal realms.</p> <p>Quasi-deities have a divine origin, but they don't receive or answer prayers. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory, they could ascend to godhood if they amass enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into the following subcategories:</p> <p>Demigods are divine beings with mortal origin. Some were born mortal and attained godhood, while others were born from the union of a deity and a mortal. Their mortal parentage makes demigods.</p> <p>Titans are the creations of deities.

A god might bestow a Blessing (see \"Supernatural Gifts\" in this chapter) to help a character in need.</p> <p>Emissaries.

An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. You can simply decide on an NPC's loyalty, or you can track a Loyalty Score using the following rules.</p> <p>Loyalty Score. An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum Loyalty Score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting Loyalty Score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes\u2014perhaps a character dies or leaves the group\u2014adjust the NPC's Loyalty Score accordingly.</p> <p>Tracking Loyalty. Keep track of an NPC's Loyalty Score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal.</p> <p>An NPC's Loyalty Score increases by 1d4 if other party members help the NPC achieve a personal goal. Likewise, an NPC's Loyalty Score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC's Loyalty Score can never be raised above its maximum.</p> <p>When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC's alignment or personality, reduce the NPC's Loyalty Score by 1d4. Reduce the NPC's Loyalty Score by 2d4 if the NPC is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons. A Loyalty Score can never drop below 0.</p> <p>Meaning of Loyalty. An NPC with a Loyalty Score of 10 or higher risks anything to help fellow party members. An NPC whose Loyalty Score is between 1 and 10 is tenuously faithful to the party. An NPC whose Loyalty Score drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.</p> <p>Crew Loyalty and Mutiny. If the characters own or operate a sailing ship or similar vessel, you can use these rules to track the loyalty of individual crew members or the ship's crew as a whole. If at least half the crew's Loyalty Scores drop to 0 during a voyage, the crew turns Hostile and stages a mutiny.

Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together (to some degree) to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single episode or season of a series, a campaign is the series as a whole.</p> <p>But while it's worthwhile to compare an adventure to these other forms of storytelling, remember that an adventure isn't a complete story until you play it. Your players are coauthors of the story with you, and the events of the story shouldn't be predetermined; the actions of the players' characters have to matter. For example, if a major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the possibility that the heroes defeat that villain. Otherwise, players can feel as if they've been railroaded\u2014set onto a course that has only one destination or outcome, no matter how hard they try to change it.</p> <p>You might find it helpful to think about an adventure not as a narrative that arcs from beginning to end with little chance for deviation, but more in terms of situations that you are presenting to the characters. The adventure unfolds organically from the players' responses to the situations you present.</p> <p>Guide Rails and Railroads</p> <p>Players need to feel like they're in control of their characters, the choices they make matter, and what they do has some effect on the outcome of the adventure and on the game world. Keep that in mind as you're planning adventures. If your adventure relies on certain events, plan for multiple ways they might come about, or be prepared for clever players to prevent those events from happening as you expect. Otherwise, your players might end up feeling railroaded.</p> <p>On the flip side, players sometimes willfully disregard the adventure hooks you put in front of them and go entirely off the rails. See \"Respect for the DM\" in chapter 1 and \"Draw In the Players\" later in this chapter for advice about dealing with this situation.</p> <p>One way to give players impactful choices is to keep multiple adventure possibilities available to them at the same time. If the characters have two or three things they can investigate or pursue, they have a meaningful choice. And if whatever threads they don't investigate turn into bigger problems, you've clearly demonstrated that their decisions matter.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/4-creating-adventures/#adventure-premise","title":"Adventure Premise","text":"<p>One way to start brainstorming an adventure is to imagine a situation that might pique the characters' interest.

Some random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming them. Helpful creatures might give the characters useful information or assistance.</p> <p>Reinforce Campaign Themes. Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes and conflicts in your campaign. For example, if a war between two nations is a major conflict in your campaign, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present threat of that conflict, including encounters with bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing invaders, lone messengers riding for the front lines, enemy war parties, and so on.</p> <p>A Life of Its Own. Sometimes a random encounter that starts off incidental can become important to the story. A random encounter with a wandering ogre might end with the ogre offering to help the characters get where they need to go, or the ogre might have something in a nearby den that is significant to the adventure story\u2014a prisoner, a stolen item, or important information. Or the players might find the ogre's personality delightful, prompting you to make the ogre a more important part of the story.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/4-creating-adventures/#bring-it-to-an-end","title":"Bring It to an End","text":"<p>The climactic ending of an adventure fulfills the promise of all that came before.

Ask your players what they want to do in a campaign.

After a session concludes and between sessions are great times to ask players for thoughts about the campaign.</p> <p>Indirect Input. The choices a player makes, starting at character creation, can indicate what they want to see in the game.

Take note of what encounters players are enthusiastic about, and seek ways to help the players' characters shine.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/5-creating-campaigns/#character-arcs","title":"Character Arcs","text":"<p>Like most protagonists in film and literature, D&amp;D adventurers face challenges and change through the experience of overcoming them. By incorporating each character's motivations into your adventures and setting higher stakes through play, you'll help characters grow in exciting ways. You can use the DM's Character Tracker sheet to keep track of key information about each character. See \"Getting Players Invested\" in this chapter for more ideas.</p> <p>Character Motivations. For each character, think about what motivates them to adventure. Motivations generally fall into the following categories:</p> <p>Goal. A character's goal is a short-term reason for the character to adventure. At the start of a campaign, this might be a desire for treasure, a thirst for excitement, or some need from a character's backstory. As characters continue to adventure, they'll find different goals to pursue, such as finding a lost relic, honoring an ancestor, avenging a fallen mentor, or defeating a villain.</p> <p>Ambition. A character's ambition is a broad, personal aspiration the character hopes to achieve through a lifetime of adventuring. A character might dream of becoming a legendary knight or bringing peace to their homeland. Ambitions might be unrelated to the character's current goal.</p> <p>Quirks and Whims. Quirks and whims are a character's preferences, impulses, or other traits. They often emerge during play, such as a character's tendency to one-up a rude innkeeper or their oft-expressed fondness for displacer beast fur.</p> <p>Players often reveal their characters' motivations through play. If you're uncertain or a character's motivations seem to have changed, it's OK to ask players for clarification.</p> <p>Family, Friends, and Foes. A character's origin (species and background) implies some amount of backstory, suggesting the character's family and what the character did before becoming an adventurer. Take note of specific background characters\u2014friends, foes, family members, and others\u2014who might appear in the campaign.</p> <p>Should these background characters become important to the campaign, work with the player to develop them in detail. Revealing a character's lost sibling or childhood rival midcampaign should be handled carefully to avoid straining credulity. Make sure a player is comfortable with new developments about their character before introducing them.</p> <p>Character-Focused Adventures. Adventures should occasionally highlight character motivations or elements of their backstory. Here are a few examples of character-focused adventures:</p> <ul> <li>A rival from a character's past shows up to settle a grudge.</li> <li>A sneaky character puts their skills to the test by leading the rest of the party to conduct a heist.</li> <li>A character learns the location of a magic item needed to save their hometown.</li> <li>A spellcasting character must undertake a trial to join an exclusive group of spellcasters.</li> </ul> <p>Any adventure that focuses on a single character should incentivize the whole party to participate\u2014even if just to help their companion. Avoid focusing adventures on one character too often, and look for opportunities to have character-focused adventures for each character from time to time.</p> <p>Setting New Goals. Characters can change their goals whenever they please, but you can encourage them to do so by giving them significant victories roughly every 5 levels. When characters accomplish their goals, consider the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>How does completing this goal create a new challenge?</li> <li>How is this victory only part of what the character wants to achieve?</li> <li>Who might be upset by the character completing this goal?</li> <li>What is a reward the character will be excited to receive that also moves them closer to their ambition?</li> </ul> <p>Use the answers to these questions to develop new character goals and to inspire further adventures.</p> <p>Building on the Characters' Actions. Sometimes it can be fun to let the players steer the campaign by having their characters' actions dictate future adventures. For example, if the characters buy a tavern using the treasure they've amassed, you can adjust the campaign so that the tavern has a role in future adventures. One adventure might involve a competitor trying to put the characters' tavern out of business. Another might use the tavern as the setting for a murder mystery.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/5-creating-campaigns/#campaign-conflicts","title":"Campaign Conflicts","text":"<p>One way to ensure your campaign's longevity is to come up with three compelling conflicts you can create adventures around.

In retaliation, Suloise survivors invoked their own magic to devastate the Baklunish lands. What magic was responsible for the Rain of Colorless Fire and the Invoked Devastation? What would happen if such magic fell into the wrong hands today?</p> <p>A central portion of the Dry Steppes, where the seat of the Baklunish empire stood, is said to remain pleasant and rich, roamed by Baklunish nomads. The former Suloise capital, by contrast, in the heart of the Sea of Dust, is beset by howling winds, terrible dust storms, and rains of volcanic ash and cinders from the nearby Hellfurnaces.</p> <p>Land of Black Ice. Those who have ventured far north of the Burneal Forest tell of a strange phenomenon. Instead of normal stark-white snow and translucent blue-white ice, there is an endless landscape of deep-blue ice partially covered in snow. Strange arctic monsters prowl these fields of dark ice. Stranger still, a verdant land is rumored to exist beyond the ice, where the sun never sets.</p> <p>Riches of the Bright Desert. The Bright Desert, walled off from the rest of the Flanaess by the monster-infested hills of the Abbor-Alz and the aptly named Gnatmarsh, is supposedly filled with copper, silver, gold, and precious stones. The harsh climate, wildly varying temperatures, and hostile inhabitants discourage exploration. Expeditions have attempted to penetrate the Bright Desert and extract its riches, but none have ever returned.</p> <p>Riftcanyon. Between the Bandit Kingdoms and the Shield Lands stretches a deep canyon, ten miles wide at the ends, thirty miles wide at its midsection, and 180 miles long. The Riftcanyon, which is more than a mile deep, is home to at least one blue dragon and has tunnels near its base that lead to the Underdark.</p> <p>White Plume Mountain. Situated just south of the Riftcanyon, the ever-smoking White Plume Mountain has always been a subject of superstitious awe to the neighboring villagers. People still travel many miles to gaze upon this natural wonder, though few dare to approach it closely, as it is reputed to be the haunt of demons and devils. The occasional disappearance of those who stray too close to the Plume reinforces this belief.</p> <p>White Plume Mountain is detailed in Tales from the Yawning Portal.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/5-creating-campaigns/greyhawk/#gods-of-greyhawk","title":"Gods of Greyhawk","text":"<p>The Gods of Greyhawk table shows many of the most popular deities worshiped in the Flanaess.

Typical of several manor houses and keeps scattered across the Plain of Greyhawk, Blackfair Manor was founded by a distinguished cavalry commander. Its stable is the most famous source of fast, durable warhorses across the breadth of the Flanaess, drawing shrewd shoppers from Greyhawk and beyond. The manor house is surrounded by farms, extensive pastureland, and a small village with a mill, taverns, a smithy, and a saddlery.</p> <p>Blackstone. See \"Mining Towns\" below.</p> <p>Blackwall Keep. One of two new keeps built to keep an eye on the Mistmarsh, Blackwall Keep is a strong, stone tower with a horse corral surrounded by a wooden stockade. Soldiers from Greyhawk garrison the keep and venture out from it to patrol the northern edge of the swamp.</p> <p>Cairn Hills. Hidden among the hills north and east of the city are ancient tombs and half-buried ruins that attract adventurers, bandits, cultists of Elemental Evil, and monsters.</p> <p>Castle Greyhawk. Travelers who follow the Selintan River westward from the city come to a stone bridge. From there, they must travel several miles northeast to reach the ruins of Castle Greyhawk. Built by the archmage Zagig Yragerne and abandoned with his demise, the ruins (and the many-leveled dungeon below) are a powerful draw to adventurers who seek wealth, glory, and magical might. All manner of marvels are said to fill the ruins, including numerous portals to other planes.</p> <p>Diamond Lake. See \"Mining Towns\" below.</p> <p>Elmshire. This sleepy town with a sizable halfling population lies on the shore of the Nyr Dyv. Fishing boats crowd the wharves. The townsfolk welcome peaceful visitors\u2014particularly adventurers who can help fend off monsters, bandits, and cults of Elemental Evil lurking in Cairn Hills.</p> <p>Ery Villages. The villages of High Ery and Erybend are populated largely by farmers who send most of their produce for sale in Greyhawk. The two villages are both dominated by two prominent families, the Fairheights and the Witherwinns. The families have a complicated history including abundant instances of feuding and intermarriage, as well as a catalog of lesser slights and favors.</p> <p>Ford Keep. A ferry crossing allows traffic from Greyhawk and regions to the south to cross the Selintan River at its first major bend. The lord mayor of Greyhawk built Ford Keep here to protect the crossing from bandits.</p> <p>Gorge of the Selintan. Soaring cliffs flank the Selintan River for nearly ten miles. Spanning this gorge, 800 feet above the river, is a stone arch bridge sculpted to look like an extension of the natural bedrock. The bridge allows easy travel between Greyhawk and Grossettgrottell. As a defensive measure, the bridge's gnome architects hid an iron pin somewhere in the bridge; if this pin is removed, the entire structure collapses.</p> <p>Grossettgrottell. An industrious community of gnome miners and foragers lives in this network of hewn tunnels and natural caverns. The gnomes trade gemstones and rare fungi in exchange for help repelling monsters from the Underdark.</p> <p>Marsh Keep. Like Blackwall Keep, Marsh Keep is newly built and watches over the Mistmarsh. The Dwarfwalk road leads east from the tower to Greysmere, a quarrying town with a large population of dwarves.</p> <p>Mining Towns. Blackstone, Diamond Lake, and Steaming Springs are small mining towns governed and protected by the Free City of Greyhawk. The city frequently dispatches adventurers to quell threats to the towns' miners and mining operations, which of late includes agents of Iuz intent on destabilizing the city's economy.</p> <p>Mistmarsh.

However, a few years ago it was purchased by retired adventurers from Ekbir, Sanjarah and Chetna Mohsin. The Mohsins brew an extraordinary ale they call Old Peculiar, which lends its name to the manor.</p> <p>Steaming Springs. See \"Mining Towns\" above.</p> <p>Stone Bridge. A small garrison in the fort of Stone Bridge keeps careful watch over river traffic approaching Greyhawk.</p> <p>Stonefort. A garrison of soldiers from Greyhawk watches over the southern Nyr Dyv from the high battlements of Stonefort. The fort also guards a gravel quarry.</p> <p>Tokhel Castle. This blasted ruin stands on a rocky promontory above the Nyr Dyv. A dead magic zone (see \"Environmental Effects\" in chapter 3) encompasses most of the ruin, and monsters guard whatever secrets the ancient castle and its dungeons might hold.</p> <p>Two Ford. The small village of Two Ford relies on river trade to supply its inns, smithies, and merchants. Ore from the mining towns is also traded here, as it is easier to transport it by river than overland.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/5-creating-campaigns/greyhawk/#greyhawk-gazetteer","title":"Greyhawk Gazetteer","text":""},{"location":"dmg/5-creating-campaigns/greyhawk/#the-big-picture","title":"The Big Picture","text":"<p>To understand the Greyhawk of today (the year 576 in the Common Year), it is helpful to picture the Flanaess about 200 years ago. At that time, the Great Kingdom of Aerdy stretched from the Vast Swamp to the Rakers, and from the Solnor Ocean to the Yatil and Lortmil Mountains. Between the Lortmil Mountains and the Crystalmists was the Kingdom of Keoland, mimicking the Great Kingdom in its imperialist approach. To the west of the mountains, the Baklunish nations\u2014survivors of the Invoked Devastation\u2014stood much as they do now. And to the north, nomadic peoples (the Chakyik, the Wegwiur, the rovers of the Hunting Lands) and the North Kingdoms were, as now, independent of the politics of the south.</p> <p>The contraction of the two southern realms over the last two centuries is the primary force that has shaped the modern Flanaess. First, the provinces of Perrenland, Veluna, and Furyondy\u2014far from the overking's throne in Rauxes\u2014declared their independence from the Great Kingdom. When Nyrond joined them (in 356 CY), the stage was set for the slow disintegration of the Great Kingdom and the ongoing rebellion that dominates the eastern part of the Flanaess to this day.</p> <p>The beginning of Aerdy's decline marked the high-water mark of Keoland's expansionist policies, as it held sway from the Pomarj to the borders of Ket. Aided by Celene, rebels in the Ulek region strove to curb the kingdom's warlike ways, and the accession of King Tavish IV in 453 CY marked a dramatic shift in royal policy. The Yeomanry and the Ulek states were granted autonomy, the Gran March and Sterich became semi-independent while remaining loyal to the crown, and the diverse peoples of this region coexist in relative peace once again.</p> <p>With this big picture in mind, you can think of the Flanaess beyond the Free City of Greyhawk as five major regions, each with its own store of adventure possibilities waiting to be explored:</p> <p>Central Flanaess. Diverse peoples clash against Iuz and the forces of Elemental Evil.</p> <p>Eastern Flanaess. The remnants of the Great Kingdom struggle to determine the fate of the lands in the overking's wicked clutches.</p> <p>Northern Flanaess. In vast wilderness expanses populated by indigenous folk, one's mettle is tested by the environment and roving dragons.</p> <p>Old Keoland. The former provinces of Keoland contend against evil monsters from the western mountains, including dragons and giants.</p> <p>Western Flanaess. The Baklunish peoples and nations navigate complex political relationships.</p> <p>Living History</p> <p>Greyhawk has a long history of ancient empires and more recent wars, but the only relevant details of this history are those that feature in your adventures. Highlight significant in-world details by revealing them in the course of your adventures. Use the following techniques to share lore with your players:</p> <p>Echoes of the Past. Features like a crater in the side of a mountain, a defaced statue in the town square, or a holiday celebrating a local hero provide concrete touchstones to past events. The characters might learn that a ruin they're exploring was destroyed in a catastrophic battle or natural disaster.</p> <p>Historical Records. Written historical details might appear anywhere in an adventure: glyphs on ancient dungeon walls, books in a library, files in a royal vault, or tapestries depicting key events. Use such set dressing to share important details. Summarize what lengthy works say, and focus on the most plot-worthy parts.</p> <p>Scholarly Expertise. Characters who have proficiency in the Arcana, History, or Religion skill can be fonts of useful information. When it would be helpful for a group to know something about the setting, ask such characters to make an Intelligence check using the relevant skill, then share plot-relevant details if their roll warrants it.</p> <p>Magical Footnotes. Spells such as Contact Other Plane, Legend Lore, and Speak with Dead allow characters to learn information while leaving you control of the particulars.</p> <p>Primary Sources. Personify the past through a tragic ghost, an otherworldly guardian, an artificial intelligence, an ancient sage, or another long-lived individual. Such NPCs give you a way to share relevant information and respond to questions from the party. If the characters miss an important detail, this NPC can reinforce details in a way books and recollected facts can't.</p> <p>Any one of these methods is useful for revealing a few details.

belongs to a player character: a home, a stronghold, and a place of power that the character develops over the course of a campaign. A Bastion offers a character temporary refuge from the dangerous world of adventuring, and it provides opportunities for a character to craft magic items, conduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and carry out a range of other activities.</p> <p>As DM, you decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to campaigns that allow characters to return to their Bastions during intervals when they're not actively adventuring. Not every character needs to have a Bastion. It's fine for some players in your campaign to opt in to Bastion ownership and others to opt out.</p> <p>There's no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character can do both at once. A Bastion has special facilities that generate benefits, and these facilities can also undertake projects while the character is otherwise occupied.</p> <p>Most importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space in the campaign. Be as permissive as you can with the stories players tell in their Bastions, but players should know their control might be limited by the campaign's larger story, which you strive to make fun for everyone.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/8-bastions/#gaining-a-bastion","title":"Gaining a Bastion","text":"<p>If you allow Bastions in your campaign, characters acquire their Bastions when they reach level 5. You and the players can decide together how these Bastions come into being. A character might inherit or receive a parcel of land on which to build their Bastion (see \"Marks of Prestige\" in chapter 3), or they might take a preexisting structure and refurbish it. It's fair to assume that work has been going on behind the scenes of the campaign during a character's early adventuring career, so the Bastion is ready when the character reaches level 5.</p> <p>The shape, style, and function of a character's Bastion are up to the player to determine. For example, a Wizard might build a tower, a Cleric might establish a shrine, a Fighter might build a fortified keep or similar stronghold, and a Rogue might establish a guildhall or lodge. Characters of other classes might choose one of these forms or combine them\u2014a Paladin's Bastion might be similar to a Cleric's shrine but as fortified as a Fighter's stronghold. And multiple characters can combine their Bastions to form a single large structure (see \"Bastion Map\").</p> <p>Every Bastion has facilities that serve basic needs as well as special ones, such as libraries, menageries, and workshops (see \"Basic Facilities\" and \"Special Facilities\").</p>"},{"location":"dmg/8-bastions/#bastion-turns","title":"Bastion Turns","text":"<p>As time passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in their Bastions, whether or not the characters are present.

After the characters have been away for 7 days, you might say, \"Time for a Bastion turn. Since you're not there, we'll assume you issue the Maintain order for your Bastions.\" Then roll for events as described in the \"Bastion Events\" section in this chapter.</li> <li>The characters spend 7 days or more in their Bastions between adventures. You might say, \"You have six weeks to spend in your Bastions. Go ahead and resolve six Bastion turns.\"</li> <li>The characters return to their Bastions in the midst of an adventure. You might say, \"You have just enough time to take a Bastion turn before you leave again in the morning.\"</li> <li>The characters are adventuring near their Bastions and resting in their Bastions at night. You might say, \"It's been a week since your last Bastion turn, so you can take one now.\"</li> </ul> <p>You can slow the frequency of Bastion turns to better serve the needs of your players and your campaign. For example, if the characters have months between adventures, you can call for a Bastion turn every month instead of every 7 days, so the characters aren't issuing so many orders or reaping too many benefits at once.</p>"},{"location":"dmg/8-bastions/#bastion-map","title":"Bastion Map","text":"<p>Encourage players to create floor plans of their characters' Bastions, configuring its facilities as they see fit and using the same techniques you use to create dungeon maps (see \"Dungeons\" in chapter 3 and \"Adventure Maps\" in chapter 4).</p> <p>In addition to basic facilities and special facilities (described later in this chapter), a Bastion can have the following features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Closets.

A defensive wall is 20 feet high and may include a walkway along its top, with a means to access it (such as a ladder or lift). Each 5-foot square of defensive wall takes 10 days to build and costs 250 GP.

The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).</li> <li>The Players Describe What Their Characters Do. Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the DM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.</li> <li>The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the DM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.</li> </ol> <p>This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&amp;D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations\u2014particularly combat\u2014the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.</p> <p>Exceptions Supersede General Rules</p> <p>General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.</p> <p>The game also includes elements\u2014class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like\u2014that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.</p>"},{"location":"phb/1-playing-the-game/#an-ongoing-game","title":"An Ongoing Game","text":"<p>Sometimes a session of D&amp;D is a complete game in itself (often called a \"one-shot\"), where you play a short adventure that lasts for just one session.

It includes a cast of nonplayer characters controlled by the DM. Often one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.</p> <p>During an adventure, the adventurers explore environments, events, and creatures presented by the DM. Battles, traps, negotiations, mysteries, and more arise during these explorations.</p> <p>Adventures vary in length and complexity.

The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p> <p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract.

If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.</p> <p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.

The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists.

A blazing fire in the hearth barely gives any warmth to the room. You see a man behind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses. Three older women huddle together at one table. And a handsome young man sits by himself at a corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks up as you enter, but the other people ignore you. \"Welcome to Barovia,\" he says. He holds a coin toward the bartender: \"A pitcher for the visitors.\" The glint of silver catches the server's attention.</p> <p>Active Roleplaying.

You said your name was Kolyanovich. Are you related to Kolyan Indirovich, the burgomaster of this town?\"</p> <p>Jared: He looks a little surprised.

Why would he do that?\"</p> <p>Russell: \"Why would he want us to come here?\"</p> <p>Maeve: \"Clearly, he doesn't think we're a threat.\"</p> <p>Amy: \"Well, he hasn't met us yet!\"</p> <p>Jared: \"He's toying with you.

But I fear she won't survive another visit!\"</p> <p>Russell: \"All right, Ismark. You bought us drinks and told us about the Devil Strahd and your sister. How can we help?\"</p> <p>Jared: \"You are too kind! First, I need your help transporting Ireena to the town of Vallaki.\"</p> <p>Maeve: \"Where's Vallaki?\"</p> <p>Jared: \"It lies to the northwest, in the heart of the valley. As the raven flies, it is less than ten miles, but the road winds among the hills and woods, and the journey takes at least five hours at speed.\"</p> <p>Russell: \"And why there?\"</p> <p>Jared: \"The town lies beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft, so I hope it's beyond Strahd's spies. And I have heard that Vallaki is well defended, with a wooden palisade and iron gates.\"</p> <p>Russell: \"As if such defenses would stop a vampire.\"</p> <p>Jared: \"Indeed. But if moving her there can keep him away from her for even a few days, we have time for the second part of our task.\"</p> <p>Russell: \"A part where you help us?\"</p> <p>Jared: \"Yes, when I help you face the vampire!\"</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ability Checks.

Insight reflects a character's skill at reading other people's moods and intentions. The DM set the DC at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful Wisdom (Insight) check, Gareth gleans information that wasn't obvious, so it wasn't part of the DM's earlier narration.

Does a 24 hit?</p> <p>Jared: A solid hit!</p> <p>Amy: And it's next to one of my allies, right?</p> <p>Jared: Yes.</p> <p>Amy: So with my Sneak Attack, that's 22 damage!</p> <p>Jared: Your blade slides into an empty eye socket, and the skeleton clatters to the ground, now inanimate and harmless.</p> <p>Amy: Then I use Cunning Action to Disengage as a Bonus Action and move 20 feet out of the melee. (6)</p> <p>Jared: Very good. Shreeve?</p> <p>Russell: I drop my sword and pull out my warhammer. Time to break some bones! My first attack is a 21 to hit for 7 Bludgeoning damage. (7)</p> <p>Jared: It tries to block your swing, but the force of your blow destroys the skeleton!</p> <p>Russell: I swing at the next skeleton with 11 to hit.</p> <p>Jared: The skeleton dodges out of the way.</p> <p>Russell: Rats. That's my turn.</p> <p>Jared: Mirabella?</p> <p>Maeve: How many can I get in a 15-foot Cube? (8)</p> <p>Jared: Three if you don't want to get Shreeve too.</p> <p>Maeve: That's probably best. I cast Thunderwave at those three, using a level 2 spell slot. So there's a loud boom, and a wave of thunderous force sweeps over the skeletons. They need to make DC 15 Constitution saves.</p> <p>Jared: They all fail! (9)</p> <p>Damage and Hit Points. The skeletons have 13 Hit Points each, so the spells and attacks in this example deal enough damage to destroy them. If a spell or an attack dealt less than 13 damage, the DM would keep track of the damage each skeleton has taken until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and is destroyed.</p> <p>Maeve: Because I used a level 2 slot, that's 15 Thunder damage, and they're pushed 10 feet away.</p> <p>Jared: They're pushed back and shattered.</p> <p>Maeve: Excellent! Four down, six to go.</p> <p>Jared: And it's Gareth's turn at last!</p> <p>Phillip: How many of them are within 30 feet of me?</p> <p>Jared: All six.</p> <p>Phillip: I hold up my Holy Symbol and ask Pelor the Holy Sun to sear these skeletons. They need to make DC 15 Wisdom saves. (10)</p> <p>Jared (rolling): Oh, those are not good numbers. None of them even got close.</p> <p>Phillip: They each take 18 Radiant damage and\u2014</p> <p>Jared: Never mind the \"and.\" Pelor does indeed smite these skeletons! They're silhouetted for a moment in a burst of brilliant light, then they vanish, leaving only their broken swords behind.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Starting Combat. While describing the skeletons animating, the DM gets ready to start combat by mentally figuring out where everyone is, referring to the map of the area and the party's established marching order.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rolling Initiative. The next step in combat is for everyone involved to roll Initiative.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taking Turns. Now each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. The skeletons go first because they got the highest Initiative: 20.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attack Rolls. When a creature attacks, whether swinging a sword or firing an arrow from a bow, its player makes an attack roll. If the total is equal to or higher than the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spells and Reactions. Mirabella casts the Shield spell. It's a special property of this spell that it can be cast even when it's not the caster's turn, using her Reaction (see \"Actions\" earlier in this chapter).</p> </li> <li> <p>Special Abilities. Auro's Sneak Attack lets him deal extra damage to the skeletons, and his Cunning Action lets him Disengage as a Bonus Action. These are examples of class features (described in chapter 3) that let characters bend the rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerability. An attack that deals Bludgeoning damage is deadly to skeletons. Shreeve knows this from past experience, which is why she drops her sword and switches to a Bludgeoning weapon. She rolls only 7 damage, but the DM knows the skeleton actually takes 14 damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Areas of Effect. Spells and many other effects in the game fill a specific area that is defined by the rules, like the 15-foot Cube of the Thunderwave spell. See the rules glossary for more on areas of effect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Saving Throws. The skeletons make Constitution saving throws to resist the Thunderwave spell. When they fail those saves, they take damage and are pushed, as defined in that spell's description.</p> </li> <li> <p>Saving Throws. Gareth's Sear Undead is a class feature (see chapter 3). As with Mirabella's Thunderwave spell, Sear Undead forces the skeletons to make a saving throw.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"phb/2-creating-a-character/","title":"Chapter 2: Creating a Character","text":"<p>You can make a character for Dungeons &amp; Dragons using the building blocks in this book.

Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.</p>"},{"location":"phb/3-character-classes/cleric/#becoming-a-cleric","title":"Becoming a Cleric...","text":""},{"location":"phb/3-character-classes/cleric/#as-a-level-1-cleric","title":"As a Level 1 Cleric","text":"<ul> <li>Gain all the traits in the Core Cleric Traits table.</li> <li>Gain the Cleric's level 1 features, which are listed in the Cleric Features table.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"phb/3-character-classes/cleric/#as-a-multiclass-cleric","title":"As a Multiclass Cleric","text":"<ul> <li>Gain the following traits from the Core Cleric Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields.</li> <li>Gain the Cleric's level 1 features, which are listed in the Cleric Features table.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.</p> <p>Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.</p> <p>When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.</p> <p>Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.</p> <p>The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.</p> <p>Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.</p> <p>Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p> <p>Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p> <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.</p> <p>If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.</p> <p>Changing Your Prepared Spells.

You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.</p> <p>Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook</p> <p>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.</p> <p>Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.</p> <p>Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.</p> <p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p> <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p> <ul> <li>Object Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</li> <li>Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.</li> <li>Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</li> <li>Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</li> <li>Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</li> <li>Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li> <li>Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</li> </ul> <p>The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>"},{"location":"phb/7-spells/spell-descriptions/#witch-bolt","title":"Witch Bolt","text":"<p>Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)</p> <p>Casting Time: Action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.
